The Singer Sewing Machine Company, respondent 2 in the appeal, was the tenant in respect of a shop under the appellant and informed him that the company had closed its premises, that respondent I will conduct his business in the shop, and that he will be personally responsible for payment of rent, and in spite of the appellant 's protest and without his consent delivered possession of the said shop room to respondent 1.
Thereupon the appellant applied to the Controller under section 13 of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949, for eviction of the respondents and the Controller directed the company to deliver possession to the appellant.
The District Court confirmed the Controller 's order but the High Court set aside the order, in a petition under article 227 of the Constitution, as having been made without jurisdiction, holding that the company had no interest in the tenancy after August 31, 1954, and nothing had passed to the respondent 1.
Held, that the High Court was in error on both the points and its order must be set aside.
One of the obligations of a tenant under section 108(q) of Transfer of Property Act, on the determination of the tenancy, is to put the landlord in possession.
If the tenant fails to do so before the expiry of the period of notice, his tenancy continues and cannot be terminated by an assignment in favour of another.
W. H. King vs Republic of India, , referred C.to.
In the instant case, the company had not admittedly served the notice as required by law and, therefore, did not cease to be the tenant and since the respondent I was let into possession as assignee he was not a trespasser and, consequently, the proceeding before the Controller was maintainable against both.
