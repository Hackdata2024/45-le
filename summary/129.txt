Two brothers who had been carrying on in partnership a business, which had been assessed to income tax under the Indian Income tax Act of 1918 and the accounting year of which was a period of 12 months ending on the 30th June each year, transferred the business to a limited company on the 1st March, 1940, and claimed in the assessment for the year 1940 41 that under section 25 (4) of the Income tax Act, 1922, they were not liable to pay income tax on the income of their business from 1st July, 1938, up to 29th February, 1940, a period of 20 months.
The Income tax authorities were of the view that exemption could be claimed only 487 for the period from 1st July, 1939, to 29th February, 1940, a period of 8 months: Held, that the expression "end of the previous year" in sub sections (3) and (4) of section 25 in the context of those sub sections means the end of the accounting year (a period of full 12 months) expiring immediately preceding the date of discontinuance or succession and the assessee firm was entitled to claim exemption from tax only in respect of the period from the 1st July, 1939, to the 29th 'February,1940, On a true construction of sections 25 and 26, the Income tax Officer is not empowered to make an accelerated assessment in the year in which succession occurs on the profits of that year and prematurely assess the successor so that he , may be able to give relief to the person succeeded.
The exemption provided for in section 25 (4) and the apportionment mentioned in section 26 (2) have to be made in the assessment year in which the profits of the year of succession fall to be assessed under section 3 of the Act.
For the purposes of the charging sections of the Act the ex pression "previous year" is co related to a year of assessment immediately following it, but it is not necessarily wedded to an assessment year in all cases and it cannot be said that the expression "previous year" has no meaning unless it is used in relation to a financial year.
In a certain context it may well mean a completed accounting year immediately preceding the happening of a contingency.
