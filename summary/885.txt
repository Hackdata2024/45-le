On a report of the Sanitary Inspector of the Municipality, the Sub Divisional Officer issued a search warrant directing seizure of a large quantity of " rotten and decomposed mustard seed " from the possession of the respondents.
The Chairman of the Municipality applied to the District Magistrate for action under section 431 and section 432 of the Bengal Municipal Act.
The proceedings started on the petition of the Chairman of the Municipality had a chequered career.
Ultimately the District Magistrate found that the mustard seed was unwholesome and unfit for human consumption on the date of seizure and directed, in exercise of the powers under section 431(2) of the Act, that the same be made over to the Commissioners of the Municipality for disposal either as manure or as cattle feed.
The High Court in revision set aside the order of the District Magistrate holding that section 431 of the Act under which the order was made did not apply to a case of seizure of unwholesome food under a warrant issued under section 430.
On appeal by the Municipality by special leave: Held, that the powers under section 431(2) of the Bengal Munici pal Act (XV of 1932), were expressly directed to be exercised by the Magistrate in respect of articles seized under section 428, and there was nothing in section 431(2) which might justify tile view that those powers could also be exercised in respect of articles seized under a warrant issued under section 430.
