The six appellants were convicted under section 304 Part II with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code by the Sessions Judge add their appeal was summarily dismissed by the High Court.
On appeal by special leave, it was contended that section 304, Part 11 could not be read with section 34 Indian Penal Code because the second part of section 304 excluded intention and was concerned with knowledge and the conviction was illegal.
Held:(i) Section 34 when it speaks of a criminal act done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, has regard not to the offence as a whole, but to the criminal act, that is to say, the totality of the series of acts which result in the offence.
In the case of a person assaulted by many accused, the criminal act is the offence which finally results, though the achievement of that criminal act may be the result of the action of several persons.
(ii)Knowledge in section 304 Part 11 is the knowledge of likelihood of death and the common intention is with regard to the criminal act.
If the result of the criminal act is the death of the victim and if each of the assailants possesses the knowledge that death is the likely consequence of the criminal act, there is no reason why section 34 should not be read with the second part of section 304 to make each liable individually.
