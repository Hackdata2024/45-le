The scope of an enquiry under section 22 of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act, 1950, is whether there is a prima facie case made out for the proposed discharge of the workman and the employer has not resorted to any unfair practice or victimisation.
Though an Industrial Tribunal can create new obligations or modify contracts in the.
interests of industrial peace or to prevent unfair practice or victimisation, its discretion has to be exercised in accordance with well recognised principles and it cannot ignore altogether an existing agreement or existing obligations.
The Automobile Products of India Ltd. vs Rukmaji Bala ([1955] 1 S.C.R. 1241) and Atherton West & Co. Ltd. vs Suti Mill Mazdoor Union, ([1953] S.C.R. 780), relied on.
Where, as in the present case, the Labour Appellate Tribunal did not direct its mind to the real question to be decided on an application under section 22 of the Act for permission to discharge the temporary employees and without deciding whether the workmen were temporary employees or not, passed an order dismissing the application on the basis of a finding which was not determinative of the real point or question at issue, held that the decision must be set aside and the proper order passed.
