The respondent was appointed on October 22,1980 for a period of one year as a "master ' of the ship called 'M V Anastasis" in terms of the appointment order under which he was entitled to two months ' wages, if the was discharged before the completion of his term The said ship on December 11, 1980, touched the harbour and thereafter proceeded to Beypore, Calicut, where the respondent was informed that the ship having been sold as a scrap to the appellant company, Steel Industries, Kerala, he should handover the ship to the company.
Consequent upon the sale of the ship, by an order dated 20.12.80 the services of the respondent were terminated.
On December 22, 1980 the respondent wrote a letter to the previous owner of the ship of having handed over the ship to the appellant company On 24.12.80 the respondent moved the Magistrate under section 145 of the for payment of necessary wages.
The Magistrate after considering all the pros and cons of the matter felt that the respondent was entitled to get compensation at least equivalent to three months ' pay calculated at $1800 per month In appeal the High Court of Kerala increased the compensation equivalent to one year 's wages.
Allowing the company 's ' criminal appeal No 240/82 and dismissing o the Master 's appeal No 661/82, the Court ^ HELD: 1 The High Court has misconstrued the various sections of the and by a strange process of reasoning arrived at the conclusion that the respondent was entitled to full compensation of one years wages even if his services were terminated before the expiry of his actual term, when in fact the ship having been treated as a 999 scrap was no longer required and therefore his services had to be dispensed A with and when the respondent himself rightly understood the terms of his appointment and put his claim at two months ' wages only.
[1006H; 1007] 2.1 There is no provision in the which equates a seaman with a master of a ship in regard to the terms and conditions or emoluments or mode of discharge or under which a matter of a ship can get a discharge certificate But under section 143 read with section 148 a Master is entitled to three months ' wages.
[1005C E] 2.2 A perusal of the relevant section clearly reveals that the statute make a well knit distinction between a 'seaman ' and a Master ' of the ship.
The definition of 'Master ' in sub section(22) of section 3 does not include a seaman.
Sub section 42 of section 3 clearly shows that a 'seaman ' cannot in the ordinary sense of the term be equated with a 'Master ' but for certain specific purposes under sections 178 to 183 it includes a ;Master In sub section (1) OF section 180, the word 'Master" has been used for the first time but even here the term has been used not to equate a seaman with a master but in quite a different context and subserve a different purpose.
[1002B, D, E F, 1003D] 2.3 There is no clear provision from which it can be inferred either directly or by necessary intendment that a master is also a seaman for the purpose of getting compensation if his services were terminated.
The various sub sections of section 89 do not at all govern the terms and conditions of a master ' but serve to carve out his duties at various levels or stages.
Sections 101, 103, 108, 119, 120, 121.
132, 143 and 199 of the Merchant Shipping Act all these govern the terms and conditions of a service of a seaman and the crew and have nothing to do with the master of A ship.
It is true that sub sections I and 2 of section 148 provide that a master of a ship would have the same rights, liens and remedies for recovery of his wages as a seaman either under the four corners of the Act or by any law or custom.
But there is no provision in the Act under which a discharge certificate can be given to a master of a ship or even otherwise, a master cannot claim the rights and privileges of a seaman because a master of a ship is an officer of a higher rank than that of a seaman.
Therefore, his terms and conditions are bound to be different from that of a seaman.
[1003E F, 3.
The contract between the master of a ship and the owner is in the nature of a contract of personal service and cannot be specifically enforced.
