A second appeal under section 100 Code of Civil Procedure 1908 was allowed by the Allahabad High Court and the matter was remanded by the High Court under Order XLI, Rule 23 CPC as amended by the High Court to the Lower Appellant Court for fresh disposal in accordance with law.
A majority of the Division Bench allowed the respondents claim for refund of the court fees on the view that refund could be ordered under section 13 of the Court Fees Act even where the remand was made under the amended provisions of Order XLI, Rule 23.
In appeal it was contended that even if reference to the rules in the first schedule was permissible it should only be to the rules as enacted by the legislature and not as amended by the High Court.
^ HELD: A conspectus of the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 makes it clear that the rules made by the High Court altering the rules contained in the first schedule as originally enacted by the legislature shall have the same force and effect as if they had been contained in the first schedule and therefore necessarily become part of the code for all purposes.
That is the clear effect of the definition of the expression 'code ' and 'rules ' and sections 121, 122 and 127 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
