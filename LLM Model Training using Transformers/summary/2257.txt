The respondents were dealers assessable to sales tax under the East Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948, and, in respect of the assessment years 1955 56 to 1957 58, they claimed an exemption from tax on sales of edible oil produced by them cal process.
The assessing authority rejected this claim on the ground that such sales we 're not exempt from tax in view of the amendment of the Schedule to the Act specifying tax free goods by the notification dated August 5, 1954.
The respondent 's appeals to the Excise and Taxation Commissioner:.
and to the Financial Commissioner were rejected but the High Court, upon a reference.
held that the notification was a law made by the State legislature after the enactment of Central Act No. 52 of 1952 which, read with article 286(3) of the Constitution , placed a bar on a State by a law imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on the sale of essential goods unless the law in question had received the assent of the President; and since the notification had not received such assent, it was ultra vires and invalid; the respondents were, therefore, entitled to exemption under Item No. 57 of the Schedule prior to its amendment by the notification of August 5, 1954.
On appeal to this Court, Held: The respondents were not liable to pay tax on sales of edible oils produced in ghanis run by mechanical power effected by them before September 11, 1956; but they were liable to pay tax on such sales made after September 11, 1956, [348E] (i) The amended section 5 inserted in East Punjab Act No. 46 of 1948 by East Punjab Act No. 19 of 1952 authorising the fixation of the rate of tax leviable on the taxable turnover, was a law authorising the imposition of a tax within the purview of the unamended article 286(3) of the Constitution.
As the East Punjab Act No. 19 of 1952 was passed after the enactment of Art 286(3) of the Constitution and after Parliament had by Central Act 52 of 1952 declared edible oil to be essential for the life of the community and it was not reserved for consideration of the President and did not receive his assent, it could not take effect during the currency of article 286(3) prior to its amendment in so far as it authorised the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchases of edible oil.
It could however take effect in respect of sale and purchases of other goods.
[344A C; 348B C] (ii) The effect of the amendment of article 286(3) of the Constitution by the Constitution (Sixth Amendment) Act with effect from September 11, 1956 was that the restriction put by article 286(3) on the operation of the amended section 5 in respect of essential goods was 336 337 lifted and the section thereafter took effect on such goods also.
There was no force in the contention that the amended section 5 wag a still born Jaw and that the section was not revived by the removal of the ban.
It was inserted by the East Punjab Act No. 19 of 1952 which was passed by a competent legislature and always took effect in respect of nonessential goods.
[344D F] Section 3 of Central Act 52 of 1952 had no independent existence and after the amendment of article 286(3) it had no force from September 11, 1956 until its repeal with effect from January 5, 1957 by Central Act 74 of 1954.
[345C D,E F] (iii) The notification of August 5, 1954 which amended the Schedule of tax free goods was authorised by section 6(2) which was a pre Constitution law outside the purview of article 286(3).
The notification did not require the assent of the President for affecting essential goods.
The notification was therefore valid and took effect in respect of edible oil as from August 5, 1954 and thereafter sales of edible oil produced in ghanis run by mechanical power were taxable.
But as the amended section 5 could not then affect edible oil, no tax was effectively imposed on it until September 11, 1956 during the currency of the unamended article 286(3).
[346A C, E F] (iv) Although the notifications issued by the State Government under the unamended section 5 which was invalid were not authorised by law and also invalid, after the passing of the East Punjab Act 19 of 1952 the result was that from the very commencement of the main Act the amended section 5 was deemed to have authorised the State Government to issue notifications fixing the rate of tax.
The notifications issued under section 5 before 1952 must, therefore be deemed to be and always to have been valid and not still born.
It was not necessary to pass another Act validating those notifications nor was it necessary for the State Government to issue fresh notifications fixing the rate of tax.
Here again, such notifications could not take effect in respect of sales or purchases of essential goods before September 11, 1956.
[346H 347C] (v) There was no force in the contention that the present appeals were not maintainable because the Financial Commissioner had already directed disposal of the case under section 22(5) of the East Punjab Act 46 of 1948 in accordance with the judgment of the High Court.
Effect had to be given to the order of this Court and the Financial Commissioner must direct disposal of the cases accordingly.
