The respondent, a Central Government officer was trans ferred from Calcutta to Jaipur by an order dated 14th March, 1985 and relieved of his duty the next day.
He, however, filed a writ petition before the High Court and obtained an interim injunction.
The writ petition was subsequently transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal, which held that the order of transfer was not mala fide or unfair, and there was no ground for interfering with it.
It, however, directed the appellants to pay all arrears of salary with allowances to the respondent and not to issue the release order unless all his emoluments were paid.
Allowing the appeal, HELD: The Tribunal having recorded positive findings that the transfer order was legal and valid and it was not vitiated by any unfairness or mala fide, should have dis missed the writ petition.
It had no jurisdiction to issue further directions regarding the release order and the payment of emoluments.
[398H] The respondent had already been relieved from the Cal cutta office with effect from 15th March, 1985.
Therefore, there was no question of issuing any fresh release order.
