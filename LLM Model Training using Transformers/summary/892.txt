The offence of attempting to cheat may be committed even though the person attempted to be cheated does not believe in the representations made to him and is not misled by them but only feigned belief in order to trap the offender.
Where misrepresentations had been made and money obtained from the persons sought to be cheated by the misrepresenta tions, there is an attempt to cheat and not merely a preparation for committing that offence.
