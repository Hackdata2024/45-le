The accused was committed to trial in July 1963 and was convicted and sentenced to death on September 4, 1964.
The appeal to the High Court under section 411A, Cr.
P.C., was finally dismissed on February 6, 1970.
The High Court left it to the State Government whether it should reduce the sentence on account of inordinate delay.
In appeal to this Court on the question of sentence, HELD : Section 302, I.P.C., prescribes two alternate sentences, namely, death sentence or imprisonment for life.
When there has been inordinate delay in the disposal of the appeal by the High Court, it is a relevant factor for the High Court to take into consideration for imposing the lesser sentence.
[549 A B] In the present case, the appellant has been for 6 years under the fear of sentence of death, which must have caused him unimaginable mental agony.
In view of the excessive delay it is a fit case for awarding the lesser sentence instead of leaving it to the Government to decide the matter on a mercy petition.
