Certain lands belonging to the appellants were compulsorily acquired under the Hyderabad Land Acquisition Act for running a country fair or market (mondha).
After the acquisition, the municipality parcelled out the excess land and sold it for a housing colony.
The High Court dismissed the appellants ' writ petition, in limine.
On appeal to this Court it was contended that the acquisition was not for a public purpose and that it was mala fide.
Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: (1)(a) Providing a village market is an obvious public purpose.
[876C D] (b) A mondha is a country fair or village market.
Market is defined in section 2(20) of the Hyderabad District Municipalities Act in wide terms and section 72 of the said Act enumerates the purposes for which property may be vested in a municipality.
This includes markets.
It inexoorably follows from a joint reading of Ss. 2(20) and 72(a) of the District Municipalities Act that the purpose of providing a market for the townsfolk falls within the powers of the municipality.
[876G H] (2)(a) Striking down any Act for mala fide exercise of power is a judicial resered power exercised lethally, but rarely.
The charge of mala fides against public bodies and authorities is more easily made than made out.
It is the last refuge of a losing litigant.
[876D] (b) What has to be established is mala fide exercise of power by the State Government although the beneficiary is the municipality.
There is no evidence of malus animus in Government.
[877B] (c) Apart from the fact that a housing colony is a public necessity, once the original acquisition is valid and title has vested in the municipality how it uses the excess land is no concern of the original owner and cannot be the basis for invalidating the acquisition.
There is no principle of law by which a valid compulsory acquisition stands voided because long later the requiring authority diverts it to a public purpose other than the one stated in the declaration.
