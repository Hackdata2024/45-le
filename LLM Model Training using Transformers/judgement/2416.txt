H.R. Khanna and R.N. Sachthey, for the appellants.
M Nanavati, B. Datta and O.C. Mathur, for the respondent.
457 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Grover, J.
This is an appeal by certificate against the judgment of the High Court of Gujarat setting aside an order of a Magistrate by which the respondent was convicted of an offence under section 67 read with section 37 of the Bombay Public Trusts Act 1950 (as adapted and applied to the State of Gujarat), hereinafter referred to as the Act, and sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 300, in default of payment of which he was to suffer rigorous imprisonment for two months.
The respondent is one of the trustees of a trust known as "Shri Swami Narayan Mandir" at Ahmedabad which is registered as a public trust in the office of the Charity Commissioner.
The trust is managed under a scheme prepared by the High Court of Bombay.
It appears that the Charity Commissioner learnt about certain constructions having been made by the respondent trustee without permission from him.
On March 22, 1962 a letter (Ext.
3) was addressed from his office to the respondent the material part of which may be reproduced: "An information is received of the Charity Commissioner that opposite the temple near the New Narnarayan building the blocks are being constructed in which shops are constructed on the ground floor of that building.
For what purpose it is constructed ? 2.
From when its construction work is started ? 3.
What amount is spent till today in construction of the same ? 4.
What amount is to be spent still ? 5.
How much income will accrue from it ? 6.
By which No. and on what date the permission of the Charity Commissioner is taken for constructing the same.
To which contractors are given the contracts for constructing the same ? His name, address, amount of the contract and other details and a copy of the contract.
If the committee has passed a resolution for constructing the same, its true copy.
If a contract is given to any contractor, then whether that contractor is related or acquainted to any member of the committee.
All these necessary information may please be sent before 15th April, 1962.
Queries on similar lines were made regarding the constructions near the respondent 's bungalow in Girdharnagar.
458 As no reply was received from the respondent reminders were sent to him on April 20, 1962 and May 10, 1962 followed by a telegram dispatched on May 23, 1962.
A reply was sent by the respondent giving the particulars of the buildings which had been constructed.
Reference was made to the resolutions of the Committee relating to these constructions together with the ,amount spent on them.
The Inspector appointed under the Act made a report dated May 4, 1963 giving the result of the enquiry made by him relating to the aforesaid constructions.
According to him 8 shops had been constructed adjoining the Narnarayan building opposite the Swammarayan temple, the estimated cost of which was more than Rs. 2 lacs.
On plot No. 98A shops were being built in four blocks.
Construction was also being made on another plot No. 98A 2 opposite the railway crossing.
On May 30, 1962 the Charity Commissioner instituted a complaint in the court of the City Magistrate at Ahmedabad giving most of these facts and stating inter alia that under the provisions of the Act a trustee who desired to invest trust funds in construction of buildings was bound to obtain permission of the Charity Commissioner which had not been done in the present case.
According to him the respondent had deliberately committee a breach of the relevant provisions of the Act and had omitted to comply with the notice dated May 22, 1962.
The gravamen of the charge was contained in paragraph 7 according to which the respondent had, without reasonable cause, failed to comply with the order and the directions issued to him under the provisions of section 37 of the Act.
The respondent filed an application (Ext. 6) before the Magistrate submitting that the investment of the trust funds made in the construction of the building adjacent to the Narnarayan Bhavan was legal and had been done in good faith.
It was for the benefit of the institution.
The scheme committee had given its consent by passing resolutions.
By an order, dated June 10, 1963, the City Magistrate held that the respondent had not shown the purpose of the new constructions nor had he furnished the date of commencement of the work as also the details amount already spent and to be spent on the said constructions.
He was accordingly convicted under section 37 read with section 67 of the Act.
The respondent moved the High Court on the revisional .side.
It was quite clear that the respondent was not being prosecuted for failure to obtain permission from the Charity Commissioner in the matter of investment of funds but the case for the prosecution, as urged by the Assistant Government Pleader before the High Court, was that in the letter dated March 22, 1962, Charity Commissioner had called for a "statement ' or "report" regarding certain construction work which was being carried on 459 by the respondent in his capacity as a trustee and since the same had not been complied with the respondent had been rightly convicted.
The High Court was of the view that the words used in el.
(c) of section 37(1) namely, return, statement, account or report have to be interpreted or construed with reference to the other provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder where those words had been employed or used.
As regards the word "statement" reference was made to Rules 17, 22 and 23.
Similarly the word "report" was mentioned in sections 34, 37 and 38.
It was finally held that the Charity Commissioner had not called for any "statement" or "report" but for particulars and detailed information regarding the various items set out in his letter which he was not empowered to do.
The Act was enacted to regulate and.
to make better provisions for the administration of public, religious and charitable trusts in the State of Bombay.
Section 2(13) define.s.
public trust.
Section 2(18) defines the word "trustee" as a person in whom either alone or in association with other persons, the trust property is vested and includes a manager.

Chapter IV relates to registration of public trusts.
Under section 17 a duty has been cast on the Deputy or Assistant Charity Commissioner in charge of the public trust registration office to keep and maintain such books, indices and other registers as may be prescribed which have to contain the prescribed particulars.

Under section 34 it is the duty of every Auditor to prepare balance sheet and to report irregularities etc.
Section 35 relates to investment of public trust money and provides inter alia that the Charity Commissioner may permit a trustee to invest money in any manner other than that provided in that section.
Section 3 6 prohibits alienation of immovable property of a public trust without the previous sanction of the Charity Commissioner.
Chapter V/which contains sections 37 to 41 is headed "control".
Section 37 gives powers of inspection and supervision to the Charity Commissioner etc.
These officers have been given, under subs.
( 1 ), the power 460 (a) "to enter on and inspect or cause to be entered on and inspected any property belonging to a public trust; (b) to call for or inspect any extract from any proceedings of the trustees of any public trust and any rocks of account or documents in the possession, or under the control, of the trustees or any person on behalf of the trustees.

Sections 38 and 39 provide for calling of an explanation from the trustee or any other person concerned on the report of the Auditor and the making of a report by the Deputy or the Assistant Charity Commissioner to the Charity Commissioner about the gross negligence, breach of trust etc.
, of the trustee.

Section 54 provides for what is called Dharmada and an account is to be submitted in the prescribed form.
Section 56(N)(2)(h) includes among the general duties of a Committee in which the management of certain endowments vests under section 56(D) to supply such returns, statistics, accounts and other information with respect to such endowments as the State Government may, from time to time, require.
It is unnecessary to notice the other.r sections with the exception of sections 67 and 69.
Section 67 provides for contravention inter alia of any order or direction made under the Act by the Charity Commissioner.
Section 69 relates to the duties, functions and powers of the Charity Commissioner.
Under cl.
(h) he can enter on and inspect any trust property and call for and inspect any proceedings of a trust.
He can further call for any return, statement, books of account, document or report from trustees or any person connected with a public trust under section 37.
The relevant rules in the Bombay Public Trust (Gujarat Rules 1961) may next be examined.
Rule 17 is to the effect that every trustee shall keep regular accounts of all receipts and of movable and immovable property and of.
all encumbrances created on the trust property and of all payments, alienations etc.
made on behalf 4 61 of the trust.
The accounts have to contain all such particulars as in the opinion of the Charity Commissioner will facilitate preparation of the balance sheet and income and expenditure account in the Form of Schedules VII/and IX and the preparation of a Statement of income chargeable to contributions in the Form of Schedule IXC.
According to the proviso to r. 17 where the trustees of a public trust are entitled to file statements in the Form of Schedules IXA and IXB by virtue of any exemption granted under section 33(4)( 'b) the accounts may contain particulars which shall facilitate the preparation of statements in the aforesaid Form of Schedules IXA and IXB.
Schedule IXC is headed "statement of income liable to contributions" and has reference to sub r. (3) of r. 32 which provides for contributions to the Public Trust Administration Fund by every public trust other than a trust exclusively for the purpose of advancement and propagation of secular education or exclusively for the purpose of medical relief or veterinary treatment of animals; certain deductions specified therein shall be allowed in calculating the gross annual income of a public trust or where the public trust is a Dharmada, its gross annual collection by receipts for the purpose of assessing the contribution.
Schedules/XA and IXB are headed "statements of income and expenditure" respectively and have as stated before reference to section 33(4)(b) which provides that the Government may, by general or special order, exempt any public trust or class of public trusts from the provisions of sub section
(2) of section 33 according to which the accounts shall be audited annually in such manner as may be prescribed and by a person who is a Chartered ' Accountant or by such persons as may be authorised by the State Government.
Rule 18 which relates to the powers in respect of audit empowers the Deputy or the Assistant Charity Commissioner inter alia to require the production before the auditor of any book, deed, account etc.
by the trustee or to give such information as may be necessary regarding the same.
Rule 22 and 23 provide for inspection and grant of entries in the public trust register and other documents.
Thus inspection and grant of copies can be obtained of any entry or portion thereof in the register of public trust or any statement, notice intimation, account, audit report or any other document filed under the Act.
In other similar legislation on public trusts the expressions.
which have been used may be noticed.
In the (English) Charitable Trusts Act 1853 it was provided by section 10 that the Board (consisting of the Charity Commissioners) may require all trustees or persons acting or having any concern in the management or administration of any charity or the estate, funds or property thereof to render to the said Board accounts and statements in writing in relation to such charity or the funds, estate, property, income or monies thereof or may also require such trustee to return answers in writing to any questions or enquiries sup.
C I/68 15 463 or statement" but in addition answers have to be returned to any questions or enquiries and the refusal to do so is punishable with contempt of court.
In the Act itself the legislature was fully aware of the true import of the word "information" as is clear from section 56(H)(2)(h) and r. 18.
It is difficult, therefore, to equate the word "statement" as used in section 37 (1 ) (c) with the word "information" or answering of enquiries etc.
which would have a much wider sweep than the word "statement" when considered from the point of view of statutory provisions and the rules in which it appears.
In view of the above discussion it is difficult to hold that any of the items mentioned in the letter, dated March 22, 1962 fall within the meaning of the words "report" or 'statement".
The enquiries which have been made can only involve the calling of information on various matters mentioned in the letter which could hardly be said to fall within the aforesaid expressions used in section 37(1)(c).
The view of the High Court, therefore, must be upheld, with the result that the appeal fails and is dismissed.
Y.P. Appeal dismissed.
