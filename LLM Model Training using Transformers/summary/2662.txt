By virtue of a notification under section 1(4) of the Mysore (Personal 'and Miscellaneous) Inams Abolition Act, 1954, the Inam villages of the petitioners vested in the State of Mysore.
The petitioner challenged the validity of the Act on two grounds, namely : (1) that the compensation provided by the Act was not the market value of the property at the time of acquisition and since it did not, provide for an adequate compensation as a 'just equivalent ' there; was a violation of article 31(2); and (2) that the impugned Act was beyond the legislative competence of the Mysore Legislature under Entry 36 of List 11 and Entry 42 of List III to the 7th Schedule as the Entries stood before the 7th Amendment of the Constitution, because, (i) the existence of public purpose and the obligation to pay compensation are necessary concomitants of compulsory acquisition of property, and so, the term 'acquisition ' must be construed as importing by necessary implication the two conditions of public purpose and payment of adequate compensation, and (ii) the words 'subject to the provisions of Entry 42, List III ' in Entry 36 of List 11 reinforce the argument that a law with respect to acquisition of property made under Entry 36 should be exercised subject to the two fold restriction as to public purpose and payment of compensation both of which are referred to in Entry 42, List Ill. HELD : (1) (a) The impugned Act provides for the acquisition of rights of inamdars in inam estates and it is intended to abolish 'all intermediate holders and to establish direct relationship between the Government and occupants of land in Inam villages in respect of which notifications had been issued.
The legislation was undertaken as a part of agrarian reform which the Mysore State Legislature proposed to bring about in the State.
Therefore, the impugned Act is a law providing for the acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights therein or for the extinguishment or modification of such rights as contemplated by article 31A and hence, the impugned Act is protected from attack in any court on the ground that it contravenes article 31(2).

Collector, ; , in which it was held that the principle of Beta Banerjee 's case.
; , that the Legislature in making a law of acquisition must provide for a 'just equivalent ' as compensation, has no application to the present case, because, those two cases related to legislation not dealing with agrarian reform and the protection of article 31A was not available to either of the statutes challenged in those cases.
A B] 2 (2) (1) Under the common law of eminent domain the State cannot take the property of its subject unless such property is required for a public purpose and without compensating the owner for its loss.
But, when these limitations are expressly provided for in article 31(2) and it is further enacted that no law shall be made which takes away or abridges those safeguards, and any such law, if made, shall be void, there can be no room for implication, and the words 'acquisition of property ' in Entry 36 must be understood in their natural sense of the mere 'act of acquiring property without importing into the phrase an obligation to pay compensation or a condition as to the existence of a public purpose.
The entries in the Lists of the VII Schedule are designed to define and delimit the respective areas of legislative competence, of the Union and State Legislatures and the principle of the maxim expressum facit cessare tacitum, makes it inappropriate to treat the obligation to pay compensation as implicit in Entry 33 of List I or Entry 36 of List 11 when it is separately and expressly provided for in article 31(2).
[12 C F] (3) The words 'subject to the provision of Entry 42 of List III ' mean no more than that any law made under Entry 36 by a State Legislature can be displaced or overridden by the Union Legislature making a law under Entry 42 of List 11.
If the restrictive conditions as to public purpose and payment of compensation are to be derived from these words, their absence in Entry 33 of List I leads to the unreasonable inference that Parliament can make law authorising acquisition of property without a public purpose and without a provision for compensation.
The true inference is that the power to make a law, belonging both to Parliament and State Legislatures, can be exercised subject to the two restrictions not by reason of anything contained in the legislative entries but by reason the positive provisions in article 31(2).
But as legislation falling within article 31A cannot be called in question in a court for non compliance with those provisions in article 31(2) such legislation cannot be struck down as unconstitutional and void.
