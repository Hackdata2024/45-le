In 1967, the High Court, in Narendra Nath Mandal vs State of Bihar & held (i) that a lessee of a mine was liable to pay royalty for the period being from November 3, 19,51 (date of vesting of an estate under the Bihar Reforms Act) to.

existence of a new lease by fore section 10 of the Act.
After this decision the State issued demand notices to respondents for payment of royalty in accordance with the decision of High Court.
Allowing the respondents ' Writ petitions, the High Court quashed the der notices.
The High Court held that Mandal 's case had been wrongly decide On the question whether the claim for royalty (1) prior to June 1, and (2) from June 1, 1958 to December 31, 1965 could be sustained.

Bihar Mines Ltd. vs Union of India this Court held that the consequence of the operation of sections 4(1)(a) and 10.(1) of the Bihar Act was that the original ntractual leases came to an end on the date of vesting and for the remainder the terms of those leases fresh statutory leases in favour of the lessees me into being under section 10(1) of the Act as a result of which from November 3, 1951, the subsisting leases came to be treated as new statutory leases wanted by the State Government in terms of section 1D(1) of the Bihar Act, 1950.
the 41 of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1949 applied only to contractual cases envisaged by Chapter IV of the Rules and not to the statutory leases which came into existence as a result of the deeming provision in section 10 of e Bihar Land Reforms.
[169 B; 163 B D] Bihar Mines Ltd. vs Union of India ; ; A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 7 followed.
Chhatu Ram Horil Ram Private Ltd. vs State of Bihar & Anr. ; ; applied.
(2) The High Court was also right in its view that the demand for payment of royalty for the period from June 1, 1958 to December 31, 1965 cannot sustained.
[168 G] (a) Section 30A which has an over riding effect on the other provisions of Act, affords a temporary protection from applicability of sections 9(1) and (1) of the Act not only to the leases granted before October 25, 1949 but also the statutory leases which came into existence as a result of the operation of 10(1) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act and replaced the former category of ses subsisting immediately before the date of vesting in the State of the ates or tenures on the publication of the notifications under section 3 and 3A the Bihar Land Reforms Act.
This conclusion irresistibly flows from the tds "or in relation to" occurring in section 30A after the words "shall not apply and before the words "mining leases granted before the 251h day of October 9".
These words, enlarge the scope of section 30Pt and bring within the umbrella its protection mining leases, granted before October 25, 1949 as also the utory leases which sprang up in their place by virtue of the legal fiction tained in section 10(1 ) of the Bihar.
Reforms Act on the . vesting in the se of the estates or tenures.
As expressly ordained by section 10(1) and (2) the Bihar Land Re forms Act not only the 'holder 017 a statutory lease had be the same as the holder of a subsisting lease for the remain der of the of that lease but the terms and conditions of the statutory lease had also 'aris mutandis to be the same as the terms and conditions of the subsisting e i.e. the original lease except to the extent in sub section
Thus the statu lease being inextricably linked up with the subsist ing_lease which it replacas a result of the aforesaid provi sions of the Act, came within the purview s.30.A of the 1957 Act.
The interpretation sought to be placed by the ellants on the phraseology of section 30A cannot be accepted as it would unduly lict and limit the scope of that section and defeat the object which it was nded to effectuate, namely, to mitigate the rigour of liability for payment of dty under section 9 of the 1957 Act after the commencement of the Act.
If, ontended by the appellants, the protection envisaged by section 30A is restricted the leases granted before October 25, 1949, section 30A would be rendered atory because on the.
coming into being of the statutory leases as a result 10(1) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, there would hardly be left any ing lease to which, section 30A would be applicable.
There can be no room doubt that the Legislature.
intended that section 30A of the 1957 Act should 'r the statutory leases as well.
A B] b) Statutory mining leases in respect of coal which sprang up under )(1) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act also acquired a temporary immunity the applicability of sections 9(1) and 16(1) of the Act until the Central Government came out with a notification making the said provisions applicable with without modification to these leases.
