Dismissing the appeal.
Held: The receipt of Rs. 50,787/ was a receipt of dividend :and was taxable under the Indian Income tax Act, 1922.
It was well established before the , that premiums received on the issue of shares were profits available for distribution and the word "profits" in Regulation 97 of Table A of Companies Act 1913 should be understood to include share premiums also.
section 78 of the Companies Act does not in any way change the taxability of dividends declared out of premiums on shares received by a Company before the Act of 1956 came into force.
If it was taxable, apart from section 78, it remains so taxable.
