The appellants employed about 1,600 seasonal workers and about 650 permanent workers.
The cane crushing process terminated on March 1,2, 1959, and on that day about 1,000 of the 1,600 seasonal workers left for their homes by the evening after receiving their dues.
The remaining seasonal workers continued to work in the factory till March 16, 1959.
Under the term of a previous award, they were entitled to three days ' closure holidays.
According to the Appellant the crushing season must be regarded as having ended on ' March 16, 1959, which was the last day on which the factory was worked and that only those seasonal workers who were borne on the muster roll of the factory on March 17, 1959, would be entitled to three days ' closure holidays.
The point for consideration was whether the "Crushing season" of 1958 59 must be deemed to have ended on March 12, 1959, when the actual crushing of sugar cane stopped, or on March 16, 1959.
when all ancillary operations in the factory came to an end and the entire machinery was at a stand still.
Held, that the expression "Crushing Season" must be given its ordinary meaning unless it is shown that in the industry in question it has acquired some other meaning.
There was no evidence, before the tribunal to the effect that "crushing season" meant the period during which the factory was actually working and not merely the period during which the crushing operations were being carried on.
Since the operations came to an end on March 12, 1959, the crushing must be held to have ended on that day, and, therefore, the seasonal workers borne on the muster roll on March 13, 1959, were entitled to three days ' closure holidays.
