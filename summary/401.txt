Sections 38 and 39 of the Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments Act, 1939 (Orissa Act IV of 1939) as amended by Orissa Act XVIII of 1953 were declared unconstitutional and void by the Supreme Court in Mahant Sri Jagannath Bamanuj Das vs The State of Orissa ([1954] S.C.R. 1046) on the ground that legislation in so far as it authorised the framing of a scheme by the Commissioner along with his associates and declared such determination as final without any scope for correction thereof by judicial intervention was an unrea sonable restriction on the right of the head of the Math as respects his interest in the Math which is a, right to bold property within the meaning of article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution.
After the judgment dated 16th March 1954 delivered by the Supreme Court in the Case Of Mahant Sri Jagannath Bamanuj Das vs The State of Orissa, ([1954] S.C.R. 1046) the Orissa Legislature passed the Orissa Act XVIII of 1954 purporting to amend not the 1939 Act which was then in operation but the Orissa Act II of 1952 which had not then come into force.
The Orissa Act XVIII of 1954 received the assent of the President on the 2nd December 1954 and came into force at once and thus the Orissa Act II of 1952 became pro tnnto amended and modified.
The 1952 Act so amended came into force from the 1st January 1955 by virtue of a notification dated 22nd December 1954 issued under the provisions of section 1(3) thereof which provided that the Act wag to come into force on such date as the State Government may.
by notification provide.
The five petitions under article 32 of the Constitution in the present case challenged the validity of various sections of the Orissa Act II of 1952 as amended by Act XVIII of 1954 on the principles laid down in the case of Mahant Sri Jagannath Bamanuj Das vs The State of Orissa, ([1954] S.C.R. 1046).
Held, that sections 42(1)(b), 42(7), 44(2) as well as section 79(A) of Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments Act, 1951 (Orissa Act II of 1952) as amended by Orissa Act XVIII of 1954 are not unconstitutional and 44 ultra vires and the contention that the provisions of sections 42 and 44 of the present Act to the effect (1) that a scheme can be framed by the Commissioner alone on a report of the Assistant Commissioner on such inquiry as he thinks fit and not by the Commissioner in association with one or more Government Officers to be appointed for the purpose by the Government (2) that there is no right of suit for challenging the validity or the correctness of the scheme framed by the Commissioner but there is only an appeal to the High Court, still continue to be unreasonable restrictions on the right of Mathadipathi as in the case of Mahant Sri Jagannath Bamanuj Das vs The State of Orissa [(1954) S.C.R. 1046] is without substance.
In the initial stage of the framing of the scheme under the provisions of the present Act there is first of all something in the nature of a preliminary enquiry by a judicial officer of the rank of a Munsif and this is followed by a regular and full enquiry before the Commissioner who is of the rank of a Subordinate Judge.
The enquiry before the Commissioner is assimilated to and is governed by the provisions relating to the trial of suits by enjoining that, as far as may be, it is to be in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to trial of suits. 'While, therefore, under the prior Act the enquiry before the Commissioner might well have been of the nature of an executive enquiry by an executive officer, the enquiry under the present Act is by itself in the nature of a judicial enquiry by judicial officers followed up by a right of regular appeal to the High Court.
A scheme framed with reference to such a procedure cannot ipso facto be pronounced to be in the nature of an unreasonable restriction on the rights of the Mahant.
The legislature might well have thought that instead of making the enquiry before the Commissioner more or less in the nature of a preliminary executive enquiry to be followed up by the affected Mahant by a regular , suit in the Civil Court, it is much more satisfactory and in the public interests, to vest the enquiry before the Commissioner himself with the stamp of greater seriousness and effectiveness and to assimilate the same to a regular enquiry by the judicial officer according to judicial procedure and then to provide a right of direct appeal to the High Court.
The right of appeal to the High Court is given in very wide and general terms because the appeal can be both on facts and on law.
