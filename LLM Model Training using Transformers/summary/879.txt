The respondent held a trade and import licence for foreign liquor as well as a vendor 's licence under the Bombay Abkari 51 398 Act.
It kept liquor in a bonded warehouse.
On April 2, 1948, the appellant asked the respondent to remove the liquor from the bonded warehouse after paying the necessary excise duty.
The respondent paid the duty, got the transport permits and took over the liquor, some of which it sold.
On December 16, 1948, the appellant issued a notification doubling the duty on foreign liquor and called upon the respondent to pay the additional duty on the liquor which was still lying in its godown.
The respondent contended that the imposition of additional duty on the stock on which duty had already been paid at the time of its issue from the bonded warehouse was illegal.
The appellants case was that the respondent was bound to pay the duty prevailing on the transport of liquor at the time of transporting the same from its premises to another place within the State of Bombay: Held, that the imposition of the additional excise duty was illegal.
Once the duty had been paid the liquor could be transported free from any further imposition, except where it was transported to a region where the duty was different from the region where the duty was paid.
There was no power in the State Government to impose duty at every movement during the course of the trade.
Though there was power in the legislature to levy duty at every movement of liquor, it had not exercised that power; nor had it delegated such power to the State Government.
