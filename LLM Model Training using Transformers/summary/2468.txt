The appellant filed its returns for the assessment years 1954 55 to 1964 65.
The Income tax Officer passed orders of assessment for the years 1954 55 to 1959 60.
While the appeals to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner for those years, and the, assessment proceedings before the Income tax Officer for the years 1960 61 to 1962 63, were still pending, for the assessment year 1963 64 (the return for which was flied under section 139 of the Income tax Act, 1961), the Income tax Officer made a provisional assessment under section 141.
He held that the appellant was not entitled to deduct the aggregate amount of losses as claimed by it during the previous years and allowed only a much smaller sum as loss which could be carried forward from the earlier years.
For the assessment year 1964 65, the Income tax Officer made a provisional assessment without allowing any deduction of loss claimed by the appellant; and for the assessment year 1965 66 the Income tax Officer called upon the appellant to pay a certain sum as advance tax under section 210(3).
The appellant filed writ petitions in the High Court for quashing the orders of the Income tax Officer for each of the three years, but the petitions were dismissed.
The High Court held: (1) that under section 141 the provisional assessment of tax must also be made in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Act, and that the combined effect of sections 72 and 80 was that a business loss can be carried forward to subsequent assessment years only when it has been determined in pursuance of a return flied under section 139; and (2) that under section 210(3) as inserted by Act 13 of 1963 and modified by Act 31 of 1964, the Income tax Officer was entitled to make an order for payment of advance tax for 1965 66 on the provisional assessment for the year 1964 65.
In appeal to this Court, HELD: (1) Section 141 bars an enquiry, at the stage of making a provisional assessment, into disputed questions of law and fact: it is immaterial that the dispute raised is complicated or easy.
Therefore the Income tax Officer was not justified.
in ignoring the appellant 's claim.
[198 D F] Under section 80 loss of a previous year under the head of income from profits and gains may be carried forward only if it has been determined in pursuance of a return filed under section 139; that is, if it is not so determined it cannot be carried forward and set off against the profit of the subsequent year or years.
But the section applies only to a regular assessment.
In the case of 'a provisional assessment under section 141, if there has been such a determination of the allowances mentioned in sub section 2 in a regular assessment for an earlier year, then under section 141(2) 194 the income tax officer must whether the assessee has claimed or not give effect to the allowances so determined.
But he has no power to adjudicate upon a claim for deduction made by the assessee when making a provisional assessment.
[196 G; 197 A 198 B; 199 B C] The section has been enacted with the object of expediting collection of tax on the basis of the return made by the assessee.
The assessment so made is summary and is based only on the return and the accounts and documents filed by the assessee.
If there be discrepancy between the return made and the accounts and documents accompanying the return the Income tax Officer may ask the assessee to explain the discrepancy but he must make a provisional assessment on the basis of the return initially filed or clarified, but cannot hold that certain claims made by the assessee are in law unjustified.
The provisional assessment does not bind the assessee nor the department and the tax paid pursuant to such provisional assessment is liable to be adjusted in the light of the final order in the regular assessment, and it is open to the Income tax Officer to impose a penalty in appropriate cases after the regular assessment is completed.
If it is held that the Income tax Officer has jurisdiction to hold an enquiry into disputed matters, the expression 'provisional assessment ' loses all significance: the Income tax Officer.
may, under such a summary assessment, without giving an opportunity to the assessee to explain his claim negative it and the assessee has no redress under the Act against any erroneous or arbitrary action because, the Income tax OffiCer is not bound to give notice to the assessee or hear witnesses and an appeal against a provisional assessment is expressly barred.
[196 D E; 198 B C; B C;199 (2) Under section 210(3) the Income tax Officer is entitled to make an order for payment of advance tax on the basis of provisional assessment under section 141, but it predicates a valid provisional assessment.
Since the provisional assessment in the present case, for the year 1964 65 is invalid, an order for payment of advance tax or the year 1965 66 could not be made.
