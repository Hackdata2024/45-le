By its order dated January 16, 1990 in the writ petition, the Court had directed respondent No. 4 to band over possession of the premises requisitioned under the West Bengal Premises Requisition and Control (Temporary Provi sions) Act, 1947, within nine weeks subject to their obtain ing any order from the High Court or acquiring any independ ent right within that period to retain possession.
In the meantime, the Land Acquisition (West, Bengal Amendment) Act, 1986, which inserted section 49A in the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 as applicable to the State, came into force on February 14, 1990 permitting acqusition of a part of a house.
A week thereafter the State Government initiated acquisition process in respect of the said premises.
Notifi cations under sections 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act were issued, and the Land Acquisition Collector authorised to take possession under section 17(1) of the Act.
However, on March 20, 1990 in a writ challenging the validity of the acquisi tion proceedings the High Court directed the status quo to be maintained regarding possession.
In this contempt petition, the petitioner alleged that the respondent had deliberately failed to hand over possession in terms of the order dated January 16, 1990.
The acquisition was also assailed as being patently bad in law.
HELD: 1.
Before a party can be committed for con tempt, then must be a wilful or deliberate disobedience of the orders of the Court In the instant case, no such wilful or deliberate or reckless disobedient, of the order dated January 16, 1990 has been committed by the respondent to the contempt petition.
[249F] 2.
The question whether the acquisition is valid or not is pending 247 for decision in the High Court.
In case the petitioner succeeds the respondent would have remained in possession of the said premises for a long time after they should have handed over the possession.
They are, therefore, directed to deposit an amount of Rs. I0,000 per month commencing from 1st October, 1990 in the Court in addition to Rs.15,000 per month they are already paying under the earlier directions.
