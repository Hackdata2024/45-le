The business of manufacture and sale of a particular brand of beedies was carried on by 0, a Mohamedan, who died in 1942 leaving a minor son, the appellant, by his pre deceased wife, his widow L, and four children by her.
Proceedings were taken first by the appellant and later on by L in connection with the partition of the properties left by 0, including the business, and during the pendency of the proceedings the business was carried on by receivers who had been appointed by the court by consent of parties on May 17, 1943.
The receivers continued the business till November 25, 1946, when during the course of the proceedings the business was put up for sale by auction between the co heirs and was purchased by the appellant.
For the years of assessment, 1944 45 to 1947 48, for which the accounting years were 1943 to 1946, the profits of the business were assessed to income tax in the hands of the receivers as the income of an association of persons, and the claim of the appellant that the shares of the profits of each of the co heirs should have been separately taxed was rejected by the income tax authorities.
The facts showed that the business was inherited by the heirs of 0 and was carried on without break during the accounting years first by L and another and then by the receivers, that the nature of the business was such that it could not be divided up and that all the parties desired that the business should be carried on as one whole with a unity of control.
Held, that on the finding that the business was carried on by the consent of all parties as one unit with unity of control, the co heirs did form an association of persons within the meaning of section 3 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, and that the income of the business was assessable as the income of an association of persons ; and the mere fact that a suit was pending at the time for the administration of the estate of the deceased or for the separation of the shares of the co heirs did not affect the incidence of taxation in the case.
