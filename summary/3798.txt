Under the scheme which culminated in the promulgation of the Central Secretariat Clerical Service Rules, 1962 (effective from 1 5 1954), it was provided that those offi cers who were otherwise eligible for confirmation in the services at the initial constitution should also pass a typewriting test to be held by the Union Public Service Commission within a period of two years from 1 5 1956.
The names of the petitioners who had not passed the typewriting test did not figure in the gradation list dated 7 2 1972 prepared for making promotions to the next grade of Assist ants.
The petitioners challenged the orders on several grounds, namely, (i) The principle of seniority contained in the Ministry of Home Affairs ' O.M. dated 22 6 1949 as inter preted by this Court in ; had not been ap plied to them; (ii) The impugned list was formulated in an arbitrary fashion; (iii) Their seniority must date back to their dates of promotion as Upper Division Clerks; and (iv) Rule 17 of Central Secretariat Clerical Service Rules, 1962 being inconsistent with O.M. dated 22 6 1949 and 22 2 1959 violates Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
The re spondent raised three objections to the petitioners ' case in their returns, namely, (i) There was a reasonable criterion for the difference made between the case of the petitioners and those placed on the impugned list of 7 2 1972 who are above the petitioners because they have passed the pre scribed typewriting test so that Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution could not be said to have been violated in this case whateverelse may have been infringed; (ii) The peti tioners not having assailed the order of confirmation of the scheme on 1 5 1958 prescribing a reasonable ground for distinction between the class of cases in which typewriting tests have been passed to which the contesting respond ents in the impugned list below and the class of the peti tioners which had not passed the test.
the petitioners could not challenge the impugned scheme of 1972 at all; (iii) A number of persons have been promoted and put above the petitioners since 1962 acting under the scheme providing the typewriting test so that there was inordinate delay in filing the petition under article 32 of the Constitution.
Dismissing the petition, the Court, HELD: (1) The alleged violation of the rule of seniority according to length of service was not decisive even ac cording to the Ministry of Home Affairs O.M. dated 22 6 1949.
This memorandum shows that it was only directory laying down a general rule of seniority which was presumably subject to other exceptional factors which could also be taken into account.

vs Union of India & Ors.
[1975] 3 S.C.R. 21, followed.
(2) A rule prescribing a typing test cannot be said to be unconnected with the duties of clerks who desire a promo tion to the next grade.
A discrimination made on such a ground could not violate Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitu tion whateverelse it may be said to violate.
[668 E] (3) A violation of statutory or other kind of rule in a particular case cannot amount to a violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
There may also be cases in which a rule made is ultra vires for unreasonableness or 665 an any other ground and should not be deemed to exist.
In such_ a case, if the rule is enforced it may on the facts of the particular case amount to a violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution also.
The petitioners case is not such a case at all.
[668 E F] (4) The principles laid down by this Court in Joginder Nath and Ors.
vs Union of India & Ors.
and in Amrit Lal Berry vs Collector of Central Excise ; , apply to the petitioners case regarding laches on their part.
