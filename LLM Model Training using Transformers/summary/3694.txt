The respondents challenged the constitutional validity of section 37(5)(a) of the Madhya Pradesh Krishi Upaj Mandi Adhiniyam, 1972, before the High Court on the ground that it places unreasonable restriction on the commission agent and puts a great burden on him for storing the goods given to him by his principal, without charging the commission for its safe custody.
The plea was accepted and the High Court struck down the impugned provision as unconstitutional.
Allowing the appeal by Special Leave, the Court, HELD: Section 37(5)(a) is constitutionally valid and there is no hardship or unreasonableness in it.
The provi sion prevents the commission agent from levying any addi tional charges from the farmer or the principal for safe custody of the goods.
but section 37(4) of the Act compensates him by authorising him to charge not only his commission from the, principal trader, but also the expenses incurred by him for the purpose of storing the produce, and the services rendered by him.
