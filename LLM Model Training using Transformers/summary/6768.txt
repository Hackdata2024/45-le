Under Section 20 of the Forest Act, 1927 certain areas were declared as reserve forest.
On behalf of the inhabi tants of the areas, the petitioner filed the present Writ Petition challenging their eviction from the said areas.
From time to time this Court had been passing interim orders and directions.
This Court also appointed Commissioners for the purpose of preparation of land records, identification of forest land and the final action to be taken under the Forest Act.
Reviewing the progress made so far and passing interim directions, this Court, HELD: 1.
The exercise involved in the process of prepar ing the records, identification of forest land and final action under the Forest Act, is undoubtedly massive but that by itself would not justify a protracted proceeding.

Mr. R.P. Pandey, one of the Commissioners has been staying at Allahabad and he does not find it convenient to shift to the site.
The matter has reached a stage where presence of all the officers and the Commissioners at the site has become almost indispensable.
Not much of his serv ices can be utilised if he is allowed to stay at Allahabad.
It would, therefore, be necessary to substitute him by appointing some other judicial officer as Commissioner.
In his place, Shri Prem Singh, retired District Judge would be appointed as one of the Commissioners.
The Registry shall take steps to intimate him of the assignment at his V arana si address.
