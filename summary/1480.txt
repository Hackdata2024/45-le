The trial court and the first appellate court decreed the suit holding that the respondents were not tenants.
On second appeal the judicial Commissioner held that the respondents were occupancy tenants and that the civil court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit.
Held, that the civil court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit.
Section 77 of the Punjab Tenancy Act was applicable only to suits between landlord and tenants where there was no dispute that the person cultivating the land was a tenant.
But where the status of the defendant as a tenant was not admitted by the landlord, section 77 did not bar a suit in a civil court.
