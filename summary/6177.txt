G.V. Ranade took four policies on his own life from the LIC during the period.
1958 to 1960.
In April 1969 G.V. Ranade assigned absolutely all these four policies in favour of his wife Smt.
Kamalabai G. Ranade and the assign ment was duly registered by the LIC.
These policies were paid up and the date of maturity of these were 14.9.72, 28.12.73, 9.11.75 and 21.12.75.
There were some income tax dues against the said G.V. Ranade for recovery of which income tax officer 'commenced recovery proceedings.
The Income Tax Officer on 27.1.71 issued a notice under Section 226(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to the Manager of the LIC at Nagpur directing the LIC to pay to I.T.O. forthwith any amount due from the LIC to or, held by the LIC for or on account of the said Ranade to meet the amount due from Ranade as arrears of income tax.
The Divisional Manager of the LIC at Nagpur intimated this fact of receipt of the notice under section 226(3) of the Income Tax Act 1961 to the assignee of these policies Smt.
Kamalabai G. Ranade, suggesting that she take steps to get the notice vacated in order to safeguard her interest in the policies.
By further correspondence the ITO required the LIC to deposit the amount of Rs.3415.70 payable against the first policy which was to mature on 14.9.72 and the LIC informed the assignee that the moneys due under the policies will be paid to her only after her getting the notice served on LIC by the ITO vacated.
On 5.9.72 Smt.
kamalabai G. Ranade flied a Writ Petition in the High Court of Bombay impleading LIC and the ITO claiming several reliefs including a direction to the LIC for payment of Rs.3415.70 and also to make a statement that no part of the said amount is due to G.V. 98 Ranade nor does the LIC hold any part of the sum for or on account of Ranade.
This Writ Petition was dismissed in limine.
Kamalabai G. Ranade filed an appeal by special leave in this court and this court disposed of the appeal on the counsel for the LIC stating that he would file the necessary statement on oath in accordance with section 226(3)(vi) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 stating that no sum of money is due to the Assessee, insured person, before the ITO except one policy in respect of which the LIC having already paid the money to ITO no statement need be made and consequently no order can be made u/s 226(3)(vi) and the appeal was disposed of accordingly.
It appears that the ITO did not revoke the order of attachment inspite of the LIC making the requisite statement on oath under section 226(3)(vi) of the Income Tax Act on 5.12.75.
This led to the filing of another Writ Petition in the Bombay High Court by Smt.
Kamalabai praying for a direc tion to the ITO to revoke all notices issued under section 226(3) to the LIC and to the LIC to pay her the amount due against the policies which had matured.
On 4.4.1977 counsel for the ITO produced before the High Court a copy of the order dated 1.4.77 passed by the ITO withdrawing the notice u/s 226(3) of the Income Tax Act and the Writ Petition was dismissed as withdrawn.
Kamalabai then sent notice to the LIC demanding payment of the total amount due against the four policies together with interest @ 15% since the delay in payment had been occasioned by the default of the LIC.
LIC made the payment of these amounts to her but disputed its liability to pay interest thereon for the period subsequent to the date of maturity on the ground that the delay was occasioned by the ITOs notice u/s 226(3).
This dispute regarding the LIC 's liability to pay interest led to the filing of Writ Petition No. 1248 of 1977 decided on January 7, 1981 which gives rise to this appeal.
The impugned judgment holds that the last two policies having matured on 9.11.75 and 21.12.75 a few days before or after 5.12.75 when the statement on oath u/s 226(3) of the Income Tax Act was made by the LIC did not qualify for award of such interest which was payable in respect of the first two which had matured earlier on 14.9.72 and 28.12.73.
This view of the High Court on which the award of interest is based is assailed on behalf of the appellant.
The dispute in this appeal is only about the LIC 's liability for payment of interest on the principal amount from the date of maturity of the first two policies to 31.12.75 and the rate of 15% p.a. which is alleged to be excessive.
99 Dismissing the appeal with costs this Court, HELD: In the instant case, admittedly assignment of the policies was made by the insured G.V. Ranade and the same was duly accepted and registered by the LIC in April 1969.
It is, therefore, obvious that the LIC was bound to act on that assignment in favour of Smt.
Kamalabai G. Ranade unless the assignment was held to be invalid by a competent author ity on a proper proceeding taken for this purpose [111B] Mere issuance of notice under section 226(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 did not have the effect of invalidating the assignment nor did the casual mention of section 281 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 by the ITO in his letter dated 28.8.72 result in this consequence.
Any further step towards formation of the final opinion by the ITO could be taken only after the LIC had made the requisite statement on oath under section 226(3)(vi) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 on the basis of the registered assignment of policies.
[111C D] The question of revocation of the notice under clause (vii) of subsection (3) of Section 226 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 arose in the present case only after the LIC made the requisite statement on oath under section 226(3)(vi) of the Act in view of its consistent stand throughout that the moneys due under the policies were held by it for and on behalf of the assignee and not the defaulter.
Mere informa tion of the assignment to the ITO and keeping the assignee informed of the ITO 's action did not amount to discharge of the statutory obligation under section 226(3)(vi) of the Act by the LIC.
Sub section (3) of Section 226 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 clearly shows that on a notice thereunder being issued by the ITO to the LIC in the present case, it was incumbent on the LIC to make the requisite statement on oath under clause (vi) thereof raising an objection on the basis of the registered assignment.
It was then for the ITO to proceed further and form his final opinion and revoke the notice under clause (vii).
[112D E; 113G H] The inordinate delay in making the statement on oath by the LIC under section 226(3)(vi) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 was the result of misconstruction of the provisions and misappreciation of its liability thereunder.
[114B] Obviously the assignee of the policies who had become entitled to receive the amount due thereunder on the dates of their maturity must be compensated by the LIC for its failure to perform its statutory 100 obligation under section 226(3)(vi) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 within a reasonable time.
Performance of this statutory obligation by the LIC in the present case being after inor dinate delay award of interest to the assignee of the poli cies to whom the payment thereunder had to be made even according to the stand of the LIC is, therefore, clearly justified.
