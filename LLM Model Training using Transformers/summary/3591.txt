In a suit for decree for Rs. 1,30,000/ instituted by the respondent/plaintiff in May, 1971, the appellants/de fendants filed their written statement admitting that by virtue of an agreement dated April 7, 1967, the plaintiff worked as their Stockist cum Distributor.
After three years the defendants filed an interlocutory application under Order VI, Rule 17 to amend the written statement by substi tuting paragraphs 25 and 26 with a new paragraph in which they took the fresh plea that the plaintiff was a mercantile agent cum purchaser.
The trial court rejected the said application and the High Court, in revision, affirmed the judgment of the trial court.
Dismissing the appeal by special leave the Court, HELD: It is true that inconsistent pleas can be made in pleadings.
The defendants cannot be allowed to change completely the case and substitute an entirely different and new case.
In the instant case, the effect of substitution of paragraphs 25 and 26 is not making inconsistent and alternative pleadings.
but it is seeking to displace the plaintiff completely from the admissions made by the defend ants in the written statement.
If such amendments are allowed, the plaintiff will be irretrievably prejudiced by being denied the opportunity of extracting the admission from the defendants.
