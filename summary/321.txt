The appellant was appointed head cashier in one of the branches of the respondent Bank by the Treasurers who were in charge of the Cash Department of the Bank by virtue of an agreement between them.
The question arose as to whether the appellant was an employee of the Bank.
(i) that the terms of the agreement clearly showed that the Treasurers were servants of the Bank and not independent contractors; and that (ii)as the direction and control of the appellant and of the ministerial staff in charge of the Cash Department of the Bank was entirely vested in the Bank, the appellant was an employee of the Bank.
If a master employs a servant and authorizes him to employ a number of persons to do a particular job and to guarantee their fidelity and efficiency for a cash consideration, the employees thus appointed by the servant would be, equally with the employer, servants of the master.
The question as to whose employee a particular person is has to be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances of each individual case, and among the many tests by which to ascertain who is the employer, the most satisfactory one is to ask who is entitled to tell the employee the way in which he is to do the work upon which he is engaged.
