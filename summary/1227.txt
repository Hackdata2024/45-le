Section 7 of the Punjab Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1958, provided that no person shall be employed about the business of an establishment for more than forty eight hours in any week and nine hours in any one day.
Under section 9 of the Act no establishment shall save otherwise provided by the Act,open earlier than ten o 'clock in the morning or close later than eight o 'clock in the evening.
The petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of the aforesaid provisions of the Act on the ground that having,, regard to the nature of their business, it would be impossible for them to carry it on in the manner in which they were doing unless the Act permitted them to work without regard to the restrictions imposed by the limitation as to hours of work of employees under section 7(1) or the hours for the opening and closing of the establishments under section 9, and that, 853 consequently, these provisions imposed unreasonable restric tions on their fundamental right to carry on their trade or business under article 19(1)(e) of the Constitution of India.
The petitioners ' case was that their business was such that the customers who supplied them with goods brought them in vehicles which arrived at their godowns at all hours of the day and night and that they received messages by telephone and telegram similarly both during day and night.
These according to them rendered it necessary that their place of business should be kept open practically for all the 24 hours of the day.
Held, that ss.7 and 9 of the Punjab Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1958 are intra vires the Constitution of India.
The test of constitutional validity is whether the impugned provisions of the Act which were enacted to afford the worker better conditions of work and more regulated hours so as to avoid physical overstrain and ensure to him a reasonable amount of leisure in the interest of the general public, are unreasonable restrictions from the point of view of the employer and go beyond what is reasonably needed to protect the worker.
judged by this test, neither the 48 hour week, nor the specification of the opening and closing hours could be said to have gone beyond what by modern standards are necessary for ensuring the health and efficiency of the employee.
