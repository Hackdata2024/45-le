Prior to the constitution of the assessee firm, its partners were members of a Hindu undivided family which carried on money lending business in India and in Malaya and which was assessed to tax under the Income Tax Act, 1918.
There was a partition in the family on June 2, 1938, and thereafter its members continued the business as partners in the assessee firm.
The firm was dissolved on March 2, 1952.
In the assessment for the year 1952 53, the assessee applied for relief under section 25(3) of the Income Tax Act., 1922.
This claim was rejected by the Income Tax Officer and an appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was dismissed on the view that in the case of business carried on in foreign territory, the business as such was not assessed under section 3 of the 1918 Act and only income received in India was so assessed; consequently, no relief could be claimed under section 25(3) of the 1922 Act.
A further appeal to the Appellate Tribunal was partly allowed as the Tribunal considered that the assessee was entitled to relief under section 25(3) except in respect of the income received by the assessee firm from certain house properties in Malaya.
The High Court, upon a reference, disagreed with the Tribunal and held in favour of the department.
On appeal to this Court, HELD : (1) The High Court was in error in holding that the foreign business of the assessee was not charged under the provisions of the 1918 Act.
The assessee was therefore entitled to relief under section 25(3).
When section 25(3) refers to tax charged on any business, it is intended to refer to tax charged on the owner of any business.
If tax is shown to have been charged in respect of the income of the business under the 1918 Act, the owner or successor in interest in relation 'to the business will be entitled to get the benefit of the exemption under section 25(3) if the business is discontinued.
In the context of the finding by the lower courts that the entire income of the foreign business was remitted to the assessee and tax imposed on that income under the 1918 Act, the foreign business of the assessee must be held to have been charged under the provisions of the 1918 Act within the meaning of section 25(3) of the 1922 Act.
[911 F H] (ii)The assessee was also entitled to relief under section 25(3) on the rental income from the house properties owned by the foreign firm which was discontinued in the year of account.
M17Sup C.I./66 12 906 Business income is broken up under different heads only for the purpose of computation of the total income.
By that breaking up the income does not cease to be the income of the business.
