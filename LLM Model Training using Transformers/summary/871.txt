In respect of a dispute between the appellant company and the respondent company which was referred to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce in terms of the arbitration clause contained in the contract entered into on April 6, 1951, an award was made on February 29, 1952, allowing the claim of the appellant.
The respondent made an application in the High Court for having the award set aside on the ground, inter alia, that the contract was void under the provisions of the Raw jute (Central jute Board and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1951, inasmuch as it had not been entered into in the manner specified in sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Act as required therein.
On December 14, 1950, the Government of West Bengal had promulgated an Ordinance called the Raw jute (Central jute Board and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, 1950, for the better regulation of the trade, and on December 29,1950, a notification was issued specifying December 30, 1950, as " the appointed day for the purposes of sections 5, 6 and 7 Of the said Ordinance." Subsequently the Ordinance was replaced by the Act which by section 16, provided:. . . any notification issued. . under the Raw Jute (Central jute Board and Miscellaneons Provisions) Ordinance, 1950, shall, on the said Ordinance ceasing to operate, be deemed to have been issued under this Act as if this Act had commenced on the 14th day of December 1950.
" It was contended for the appellant that the notification dated December 29, 1950, could not be read as having brought sections 5, 6 and 7 Of the Act into force, because, on a plain reading of it, the notification did not purport to bring any of the sections of the Act into force, but expressly brought sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Ordinance into force and that the said sections of the Act not having been brought into force, the contract in question was valid and, consequently, the award was binding and enforceable.
Held, that in order to give full effect to the two legal fictions created in section 16 of the Act that the Act shall be deemed to have commenced on December 14, 195o, and that the notification issued under the Ordinance shall be deemed to have 80 been issued under the Act, the principle of mutatis mutandis has to be adopted and the word " Act " substituted for the word " Ordinance " used in the notification dated December 29, 1950.
Consequently, the provisions of sections 5, 6 and 7 Of the Act were applicable to the contract in question.
