The Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, a Society established under the Societies Registration Act in the year 1929 was redesignated as the Indian Council of Agricultural Research after the advent of Independence.
Till 1965, the ICAR was largely functioning as a coordinating agency and apex body for financing research projects, but with effect from 1966 the administrative control over the Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) and other such Institutes were transferred to ICAR, simultaneously placing the staff of such Institutes at the disposal of the ICAR A department of Agricultural Research and Education was set up in the Ministry of Agriculture and the said department came into existence on 15.12.1973.
The ICAR was fully financed by the Department of Agricultural Research and Education of the Government of India.
ICAR started an Agricultural Research Service with effect from 1.10.1975, and the relevant grades and pay scales as on 31.12.1985 were: Grade of Scientist S in pay scale Rs. 550 900, Scientist S I in Rs. 700 1300, Scientist S 2 in Rs. 1100 1600, and Scientist S 3 in Rs. 1500 2000.
The Scientists of the ICAR who were earlier covered by the Third Pay Commission pay scales had been demanding parity in pay scales with the employees of the Agricultural Universities who were also financed by the ICAR After persistent demand, the ICAR agreed to revise the pay scales with effect from 1.1.1986 by notification dated 9th March, 1989.
This notification benefited some of the Scientists, but was denying the principles of 'Equal Pay for Equal Work ' in the case of the appellants and the like, and the said notification had further placed persons much junior to many of the appellants in a higher scale of pay, resulting in violation of the fundamental rights of the appellants guaranteed under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
Some of the appellants in this appeal had earlier filed a Writ Petition before this Court under Article 32 challenging the aforesaid notification and for other connected reliefs, which was disposed of on 3rd May, 1990, directing the appellants to approach the Central Administrative Tribunal, and a further declaration was made that the Tribunal shall treat the petition as a Representative Petition.
Certain clarifications were issued by the ICAR by its letter dated 31st March, 1989 and by orders dated 14th June, 1989, 6.11.1989 and 6.7.1989.
These orders not only revised the pay scales but also gave new designations to the various posts held by the appellants.
Existing Grade Existing New Revised Pay scale designation pay scale 1.
Scientist,S 2 Rs.1100 50 1600 Scientist Rs. 3000 100 with service (Senior 3500 125 5000 upto eight scale) years.
Scientist,S 2 Rs.1100 50 Scientist Rs. 3700 125 with service 1600 (Selection 4950 150 5700 exceeding grade) eight years 3.
Scientist,S 3 Rs.1500 60 Scientist Rs. 3700 125 with service 1800 100 2000 (Selection 4950 150.5700.
upto 16 years Grade) 4.
Scientist,S 3 Rs.1500 50 Principal Rs. 4500 l50 with service 1800 100 2000 Scientist 5700 200 7300 exceeding 16 years The appellants filed an application under Section 19 of the Administrative Tribunal 's Act before the Principal Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Delhi and contended that according to the notification dated 9.3.1989 together with the subsequent clarifications, juniors and less meritorious Scientists and who were drawing lesser basic pay as on 31.12.1985 than the appellants had been placed in higher pay scales causing great resentment amongst a large number of Scientists including the appellants.
Not being successful before the Tribunal, the appellants appealed to this Court and contended that Scientists S 3 in pre revised scale of Rs. 1500 2000 having completed total service in the ARS as on 31.12.1985 exceeding 16 years had been placed in the scale of Rs. 4500 7300, whereas Scientists S 3 who were in the same pre revised scale of Rs. 1500 2000 but had put in total service in the ARS as on 31.12.1985 upto 16 years have been placed in the scale of Rs. 3700 5700.
Similarly, Scientists S 2 who were in the pre revised scale of Rs. 1100 1600 and had completed total service of more than 8 years in the ARS as on 31.12.1985 had been put in the scale of Rs. 3700 5700, but those having completed total service upto 8 years as on 31.12.1985 had been put in the scale of Rs. 3000 5000.
It was further submitted by the appellant that in the ICAR there were two streams for career advancement of the Scientists.
The slower stream is the five yearly assessment, and the faster one is the direct selection through advertisement to various posts at All India level, and that in the direct selection, the existing Scientists can also compete with the other Scientists from non lCAR Institutions, that the criterion of eight years of qualifying service for getting the scale of Rs. 3700 5700, and 16 years of qualifying service for getting the scale of Rs. 4500 7300 completed ignores the period of service put in the grades of S 2 or S 3 respectively, and that this clearly shows the utter disregard for merit and competence of the Scientists working on these posts of S 2 or S 3.
It was also submitted that the impugned notification was not only unreasonable and discriminatory, but had resulted in grave injustice to the Scientists directly selected as Scientists S 2 and S 3 by taking into consideration the total length of service in the ARS as the only criterion thereby giving a complete go bye to merit and competence.
The respondents opposed the appeal by contending that on persistent demand of the appellants and other scientists for giving them better pay scales than those recommended by the Fourth Pay Commission, the Government introduced University Grant Commission pay package for them.
The designations of Scientists on various grounds had been suitably amended so as to conform to their respective level of responsibility.
Scientist S 2 having less than 8 years of service as on 31.12.1985 were placed in the revised scale of Rs. 3000 5000, whereas those having more than 8 years of prescribed service as on 31.12.1985 were placed in the scale of Rs. 3700 5700.
It was further contended that efforts were being made to devise means by which the affected Scientists may be able to take their chance for appointment to higher management positions.
Allowing the appeal, this Court, HELD :1.
While introducing a new scheme of pay scales and fixing new grades of posts, some of the incumbents may have to be put to less advantageous position than others, but at the same time the granting Of new pay scales cannot be allowed to act arbitrarily and cannot create a situation in which the juniors may become senior or vice versa.
[450 B] 2.
The appellants are justified in their submission that they were also entitled to the higher pay scale on the post of Scientists S 2 as well as S 3 specially when they were recruited on those posts much earlier to those who have now become entitled to higher pay scales under the impugned notification.
They are also right in their submission that it also mars their future chances of promotion on the higher posts.
[452 A B] 3.
The appellants are Scientists who are rendering great service to the nation and no justification is found as to why the appellants or any other Scientists in ICAR placed in similar position like the appellants should be deprived the benefit of the revised pay scales on the higher post of S 2 or S 3, in case they were appointed by direct recruitment or by selection on merit cum seniority on the post of Scientists S 2 or S 3 prior to those who have now become entitled to higher pay scale under the impugned notification dated 93.1989.
[453 B C] 4.
The Tribunal itself had found force and justification in grievances made by the appellants and had granted six months time to the respondents to take appropriate action.
Opportunities were granted to the respondents to come with a scheme granting appropriate relief to the appellants, but they were unable to come out with any concrete proposal or scheme redressing the grievances of the appellants.
[452 H; 453 Al 5.
The respondents to issue appropriate orders so that any of the appellants or the like working as Scientist S 2 or S 3 on or before 31.12.1985 earlier to anyone of the Scientists getting benefit of the revised pay scales under the impugned notification dated 9.3.1989 also get a similar benefit of revised pay scale of Rs. 4500 7300 in the case of S 3 and pay scale of Rs. 3700 5700 in the case of S 2.
Such revised pay scales shall a be given from 1.1.1986 as given to S 2 and S 3 Scientists under the impugned notification.
Suitable action in this regard to be taken and the entire amount to be paid within six months.
