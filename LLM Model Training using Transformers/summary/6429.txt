Some employees belonging to West Bengal Civil Service (Executive) filed a writ petition before the High Court, praying for a direction to the State Government to frame appropriate seniority rules.
The High Court passed an inter im order directing the State Government to frame seniority rules and determine the inter se seniority on that basis within one month of the order.
On an application moved by the petitioners the same Judge passed an interim order that the seniority rules framed pursuant to the Court 's order would not be given effect to without leave of the Court and without notice to the writ petitioners.
On another applica tion moved by the writ petitioners, the same Judge re strained the State Government from taking any further action on the basis of the draft rules of seniority.
Later, the Judgment was delivered allowing the writ petition, holding that the draft rules were ultra vires.
Aggrieved, the State Government preferred an appeal before a Division Bench.
The Division Bench stayed the operation of the judgment and decree passed by the Single Judge.
The Division Bench also directed that the State Government may proceed with the final assessment of the seniority rules.
Aggrieved against the said order the writ petitioners filed a Special Leave Petition which was dismissed with a request to the High Court to dispose of the pending writ petition expeditiously within two months.
The High Court extended the stay till the disposal of the appeal and directed status quo.
Against this order, the original respondents in the writ petition filed a Special Leave Petition before this Court.
This Court passed an interim order to the effect that the order passed by this Court earlier would hold the field, not with standing any contrary order passed by the High Court.
Later, granting special leave, this Court observed 377 that in view of the interim order no further order need be passed.
The present application has been filed by the State for clarification of the two orders of this Court in the context of the order dated 15.9.1989 of the High Court.
Disposing of the application, this Court.
HELD: 1.1 It is the settled principle of law that any order or direction pronounced by this apex Court in exercise of its jurisdiction in any matter pending before it, that order or direction is binding on all courts within the territory of India and should be implemented and executed in all its rigour.
[484D] 1.2 From the report sent by the Division Bench of the High Court dated 15th September, 1989 it seems the latter Division Bench extended the 8 weeks stay on the grounds firstly that the Order of this Court dated 29.8.1989 has not prevented the Division Bench from passing such order and secondly that the 8 weeks stay stood vacated w.e.f. 4th September, 1989.
But in fact, the Order of the Court dated 29.8.1989 has restored the order of the first Division Bench of the High Court dated 10.7.1989 on the expiry of 8 weeks and that the 8 weeks stay had expired only by 9.9.1989 and not on 4.9.1989.
[484E F] 1.3 It is open to the State Government to act in accord ance with the order dated 10.7.1989 of the High Court.
The Order of this Court dated 7.9.1989 in SLP No. 10670/89 has clarified the position to the effect that the Order of this Court dated 29.8.1989 shall hold the field notwithstanding the contrary order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court.
The "contrary order" mentioned in the order dated 7.9.1989 refers to the order dated 4.9.199.
The resultant position is that this Court by the order dated 7.9.1989 has rendered the order of the second Division Bench of the High Court dated 4.9.1989 inoperative and ineffective.
Subse quently, SLP No. 10670/89 was disposed of after grant of leave.
Thus the matter now stands concluded that from 10.9.1989 onwards the order of the first Division Bench dated 10.7.1989 has become operative and executable and the interim direction given by that order is brought back to life and resuscitated.
