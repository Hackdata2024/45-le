Under the C. P. and Berar Local Self Government Act 1920, the District Council of Bhandara.
in 1925, imposed a terminal tax on the export of bidis and bidi leaves by rail out of Bhandara district.
By the Government of India Act, 1935, terminal tax was included in the Federal Legislative List but section 143 (2) of the Act provided that such a tax which was being lawfully levied under a law in force on January 1, 1935, may continue to be levied until provision to the contrary was made by the Federal Legislature.
The District Council continued to leavy and collect the tax.
In 1948 the C P. and Berar Local Government Act, 1948, came into force which repealed the 1920 Act.
It replaced the District Council, Bhandara, with three janapada Sabhas.
Clause (c) ;of the proviso to the saving section section 192 provided that 'all rates, taxes and cesses due to the District Council shall be deemed to be due to the Sabha to whose area they pertained, 71 By an amending Act of 1949 the Provincial Legislature replaced cl.
(b) of the proviso to section 192 by a new cl.
(b) which, inter alia, continued in force all taxes which were in force immediately before the commencement of the 1948 Act, this amendment was given retrospective effect from the commencement of 1948 Act.
The appellant contended that the 1948 Act which repealed the 1926 Act did not save the terminal tax, and once the tax was discontinued the Provincial Legislature had no power left to impose it afresh and that the amendment was accordingly beyond its legislative competence_.
The respondent contended that section 143 (2) of the Government of India Act, 1935.
vested in the Provincial Legislature plenary power to legislate in respect of every tax which was being lawfully levied in the province, that cl.
(c) of the proviso to section 192 of the 1948 Act saved the tax and that the amendment was validly made and it saved the tax with retrospective effect from the date of the repeal of the 1920 Act.
Held, that the terminal tax was validly continued by the retrospective amendment of cl.
(b) to the proviso of section 192 of 1948 Act.
Section 143 (2) of the Government of India Act, 1935, did not confer upon the Provincial Legislature any plenary power of legislation in respect of taxes which were being validly imposed.
But it did confer upon the Provincial Legislature a limited legislative power to enact a law with reference to the tax levy so as to continue it.
The power of the Provincial Legislature to repeal the 1920 Act which imposed the tax was co extensive with its power to enact such a law.
In exercise of this limited legislative power the Provincial Legislature was competent to enact the Amending Act of 1949.
Attorney General for Ontario vs Attorney General for the Dominion, , referred to.
Clause (c) of the proviso to section 192 of the 1948 Act did not save the future imposition of the tax; it merely provided for the collection of taxes already accrued in favour of the District Councils by the successor Sabhas.
The words in this clause "due to the District Council" referred only to taxes which had accrued on the date of the repeal of the 1920 Act and did not include taxes which accrued later and became payable subsequent to that date.
The subsequent amendment of 1949 could not be take a into account in construing cl.
(c) and for determining the intention of the legislature.
