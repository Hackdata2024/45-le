The appellant challenged the election of the 1st respondent to the, Legislative Assembly on the ground that the latter had embraced Buddhism and had ceased to be a member of a Scheduled caste within the meaning of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, and was thus disentitled from being a candidate for the particular seat.
The Election Tribunal upheld the contention and set aside the election.
On appeal, the High court held that the conversion of the 1st respondent to Buddhism had not been established by evidence and upheld his election.
On appeal to the Supreme Court, HELD : (i) The word "profess" in the Order means "to declare one 's belief in".
A declaration of one 's belief must necessarily mean a declaration in such a way that it would be known to those whom it may interest.
Therefore, if a public declaration is made by a person that he has ceased to belong to his old religion and has accepted another religion he will be taken as professing the other religion.
It is unnecessary to enquire further as to whether the conversion to another religion was efficacious.
[859 A D] (ii)No doubt the definition of "Hindu" contained in the Explanation to Article25 is expanded but that is only for the purposes of sub cl.
(2) of cl.
(2)of that Article and for no other.
The mention of Sikh religion in Para 3of the Order clearly shows that the word "Hindu" in the order is used in the narrower sense of orthodox Hindu religion which recognises castes and contains injunctions based on caste distinctions.
It is not comprehensive enough to include Buddhism.
