Allowing the appeal to this Court, ^ HELD: There was a clear error of jurisdiction on the part of the State Transport Appellate Tribunal and the Revenue Appellate Tribunal in interfering with the issue of permit to the appellant.
The High Court was, therefore, not right in dismissing the writ application.
[190D E] Appeal is a creature of the statute.
Section 64 of the , is the only section creating rights of appeal against the grant of permit and other matters.
But there is no appeal provided against an order issuing a permit in pursuance of an order granting the permit.
