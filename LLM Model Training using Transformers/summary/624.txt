The Official Liquidator got a complaint under sections 120 B, 406, 467 and 477A, 'Indian Penal Code filed before the Presidency Magistrate against the appellants one of whom was a past director and the other the Managing Director of the Bank of Commerce Ltd., which was in compulsory liquidation.
The appellants applied to the Presidency Magistrate for dismissal of tile complaint on the ground that the Official Liquidator was incompetent to prefer the complaint as there was no sanction of the Company judge.
This was dismissed.
The appellants then applied to the High Court for quashing the criminal proceedings on the ground that the prosecution was ab initio void because of the absence of a prior direction judicially given by the High Court under section 237(1) of the Indian Companies Act.
The High Court rejected the application.
Held, that a direction of the Court under section 237(1) of the Indian Companies Act was not a condition precedent to the prosecution of the appellants by the Official Liquidator.
In fact, a valid and proper direction had been given by the Court under section 237(1) to the Official Liquidator for the prosecution of the appellants.
In giving a direction under this section the Court could act ex parte and it was not necessary to give to the appellants any opportunity of being heard.
Section I79 Of the Companies Act deals with the powers of liquidators to institute or defend legal proceedings with the sanction of the Court and section 239(1) deals with the powers of the Court to give directions for prosecution of delinquent directors, etc.
In the present case, the Court had made an order under section I79 giving liberty to the Official Liquidator to institute or defend legal proceedings, and the Official Liquidator was entitled to lodge the complaint against the appellants even without a direction under section 237(1).
