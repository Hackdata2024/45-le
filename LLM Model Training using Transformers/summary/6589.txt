The appellant was manufacturing Hacksaw blades and Bandsaw falling under Tariff Item No. 51 A(iv) of the Cen tral Excise Tariff.
On 26.3.1985 they filed a classification list as per Rule 173 B of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 in respect of their products furnishing the tariff rate of 15% Ad valorem by mistake instead of furnishing the effective rates of duty as per Notification No.85/85 CE dated 17.3.1985.
The Assistant Collector of Central Excise ap proved the classification list on 3.6.1985.
On 31.10.1985 the appellant filed a revised classification list with the effective rates of its products with retrospective effect from 26.3.1985 which was also approved by the Assistant Collector of Central Excise.
On 30.10.1985 the appellant made an application under section 11B of the for refund of excise duty claiming that they had paid excess excise duty from 1.4.1985 to 31.8.1985.
By its order dated 13.12.1985 the Assistant Collector of Central Excise allowed the claim only partly but rejected the claim for the period from 1.4.1985 to 27.4.1985 on the ground that the claim was barred under section 11B of the Act because the 'relevant date ' for preferring the claim for the appellant was the date of payment of duty and the duty had been paid by adjustment in the personal ledger account as and when goods were removed; The order of the Assistant Collector was confirmed in the appeal by the Collector of Central Excise (Appeals).
Appellant 's further appeal to the Customs Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal was also unsuccessful.
In appeal to this Court under section 35L of the it was contended on behalf of the appellant (i) that mere debiting in the personal ledger account should not be taken as the 2 starting point for limitation and the, relevant date should be the date on which ART 12 Returns, which were filed on a monthly basis, were assessed: and (ii) that clause (e) of Explanation to Section 11 (B) was applicable to the case.
Allowing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1.

There will be no time bar for refund if the duty is paid under protest.

[6H; 7A] 2.
In the instant case, the classification list filed by the appellant for the period 1.4.1985 to 27.4.1985 was not approved till 3.6.85.
From provisions of Rules 173B, 173C and 173CC of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 it is clear that clearances can be made only after the approval of the list by the particular officer.
However, if there is likely to be delay in accordance with the approval the officer can allow the assessee to avail himself of the procedure prescribed under Rule 9B for provisional assessment of goods.
Between 1st April, 1975 when the classification list was filed and 3rd June, 1985 when the list was approved, the assessee was clearing the goods by determining the duty himself and debiting the amount of duty in his personal ledger account.
The amount of duty paid by him was obviously provisional and subject to the result of the final approval by the officer concerned.
In these circumstances, the clearance of goods made by the appellant between 1st April and 3rd of June, 1985 were in accordance with the procedure for provisional assessment.
In such a situation clause (e) of para (B) of the Explanation under section 11 B will be attracted.
The RT 12 Return for the month of April, 1985 was filed on 8.5.1985 and the same was assessed on 29.10.1985.
It is, therefore, only from the date of this assessment that time bar in section 11 B will operate.
The refund application having been filed on 30th October, 1985 cannot, therefore, said to be time barred.
