Rule 109 of the Uttar Pradesh Police Regulations dealing with the investigation of crimes enjoins upon the police officer when an investigation is closed for the day to note the time and place at which it closed and also lays down that throughout the investigation the diary must be sent daily to the Superintendent of Police on all days on which any proceedings are taken.
The question that had to be decided by the court was as to whether the appellants took part in the dacoity and the case of the prosecution depended mainly on the identification of the appellants.
It was found that the investigating officer did not send the case diary daily to the Superintendent of Police but only all together at the end of the period of investigation.
It was contended for the appellants that the case diary could not be relied upon as it enabled the officer to make alterations during the course of the period of investigation and that as there had been an infraction of r. 109 of (1) ; ; 735 the Uttar Pradesh Police Regulations which had resulted in prejudice, the whole trial was vitiated thereby.
Held:(1) Rule 109 of the Uttar Pradesh Police Regulations has no statutory foundation but is only an injunction by the executive Government to the police officers as to how they must regulate their work and conduct themselves during the course of investigation and a failure to comply with the rule relating to the submission of the police diary cannot vitiate the trial.
Hafiz Mohammad Sanii and others vs Emperor (A.I.R. 1931 Patna 15O), approved.
Observations in Tilkeshwar Singh and others vs The State of Bihar ([1955] 2 S.C.R. 1043), followed.
(2) It could not be said in the absence of compelling reasons that because the investigating officer did not send the case diary to the superior officers every day the same is unworthy of credit particularly in view of the fact that the courts below have cast no doubt upon its genuineness.
