Dismissing the appeal by special leave, the Court ^ HELD: The abatement stands in the way of the appeal being heard on merits.
In the instant case, (a) on the death of the sole respondent to the appeal the right to sue survived to his Legal representatives; (b) no application having been made within 90 days of the death.
the appeal abated on the 11th of March, 1979 and an application for having the abatement set aside could have been made within the period of 60 days following that date, under Article 121 of the Limitation Act; and (c) the application actually made to set aside the abatement was time barred by more than three months and a half.
The clerk of the learned counsel for the appellant was served with a copy of the application dated 23rd February, 1979 on that date itself and no reason, good, bad or indifferent is assigned for the failure of that counsel right from the 20th February, 1979 to the 29th August, 1979 either for having the legal representatives of the deceased brought on the record or for having the abatement set aside after it had taken place.
His knowledge of the death of the respondent must be attributed to the appellant State also and his negligence in not moving the Court in time must be deemed to be that of the appellant.
