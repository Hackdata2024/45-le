The State Government issued a Notification on November 25, 1958 In exercise of power vested under Section 4 of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948.
This Notification exempted 'cotton fabrics of all varieties ' from sales tax.
Under it, patta as an item of cotton fabric stood exempted from tax liability.
Subsequently, another Notification was issued on December 1, 1973 under Section 3 A of the Act.
This Notification pre scribed a rate of tax higher than that provided by Section 3 of the Act which contains the charging provision and pre scribes a uniform rate of tax on sales.
Section 3 A empowers the State Government to modify the rate of tax by Notifica tion.
This Notification of 1973 was issued without withdraw ing the earlier Notification of 1958.
The High Court, affirming the order of the Tribunal, held that in the absence of a Notification withdrawing the earlier Notification of 1958, sales tax would not be exigi ble in terms of the Notification of 1973.
Allowing the Appeal, HELD: (Per majority Pathak, CJI and Ranganath Misra, J., Ray, J. dissenting) 1.
The High Court was not justified in holding that in the absence of a notification withdrawing the earlier Noti fication of 1958, sales tax would not be exigible in terms of the Notification of 1973.
The order of the Tribunal, which has been affirmed by the High Court, is set aside and the assessment restored.

The Notification of 1958 issued under Section 4 of the Act exempted 'cotton fabrics of all varieties ' from sales tax.
The Notification of 1973 under Section 3 A of the Act prescribed sales tax of 7% on the sale of beltings of all kinds.
There is no dispute that patta is a kind of 94 belting material and, on being treated as cotton fabric, was exempted from sales tax.
[95FG] 3.
Section 3 is the charging provision; Section 3 A authorises variation of the rate of tax and Section 4 pro vides for exemption from the tax.
When after a Notification under Section 4 granting exemption from liability, a subse quent Notification under Section 3 A prescribes the rate of tax, the intention is to withdraw the exemption and make the sale liable to tax at the rate prescribed in the Notifica tion.
[96B D] 4.
As the power both for the grant of exemption and the variation of the rate of tax vests in the State Government and it is not the requirement of the Statute that a Notifi cation of recall of exemption is a condition precedent to imposing tax at any prescribed rate by a valid Notification under Section 3 A, the second Notification can easily be treated as a combined Notification both for withdrawal of exemption and also for providing higher tax.
[96D E] 5.
The exemption was in regard to a class of goods and while the exemption continues, a specific item has now been notified under Section 3 A of the Act.
[96F] (Per Ray, J. dissenting) 1.
Cotton beltings fail within 'beltings of all kinds ' as notified under Section 4 of the Act, being exempt from the imposition of sales tax.
As there is a general exemption granted by the Notifications issued in 1957 and 1958 exempt ing 'cotton fabrics of all kinds ', it is not possible to hold, in any view of the matter, that it will be excisable to sales tax on the basis of the Notification dated December 1, 1973 under Section 3 A of the said Act, by the Govern ment.
i98F; G H] 2.
So long as the general exemption granted under Sec tion 4 with regard to 'cotton fabrics of all kinds ' contin ues, no sales tax can be imposed on beltings of all kinds which fail within the 'cotton fabrics of all kinds ' and the general exemption under Section 4 will prevail over the Notification made under Section 3 A of the Sales Tax Act.
[99GH] 3.
It is not possible to subscribe to the view that since the Notification under Section 3 A has been made subsequent to the Notification issued under Section 4 of the Act, the subsequent Notification under Section 3 A will prevail over the general exemption granted under Section 4 of the Act.
