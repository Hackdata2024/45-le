The assessee, owners of a tea estate in Assam, after carrying on the business of cultivation, manufacture and sale of tea during the years 1948 to 1953 sold the tea estate on July 9, 1953.
In 1961, they received a notice from the Agricultural Income tax Officer to furnish returns of their agricultural income for the assessment years 1949 50 to 1953 54 in respect of that tea estate.
They did not submit any returns.
Thereafter, they received a notice of demand under section 23 of ' the Assam Agricultural Incometax Act, 1939, for payment of the tax assessed on best judgment basis under section 20(4).
The assessees were not served with any notice under s.19(2) which provides for a notice to be served personally on the assessee, during the respective years, nor under section 30 of the Act which deals with escaped assessment.
The purchasers of the tea estate were served.
in 1961, with assessment orders under section 20(4) in respect of the assessment years 1951 52 to 1955 56 with notices of demand for payment of the tax assessed for each year.
These assessees were also not served with any notice under section 19(2) or section 30.
All the assessees challenged the assessments in writ petitions and the High Court allowed the petitions.
In appeal to this Court, it was contended that the assessment proceedings commenced with the publication of a general notice under section 19(1), that it was open to the Agricultural Income tax Officer to make a best judgment assessment under section 20(4) without any limitation as to time and that it was not necessary to issue any individual notice under section 19(2) or to initiate proceedings under section 30.
HELD: Notwithstanding the difference in language between section 20(4) of the Act and section 23(4) of the Income tax Act the principles laid down by this Court in interpreting sections 22, 23 and 34 of the Income tax Act apply in the interpretation of sections 19, 20 and 30, the corresponding sections of the Assam Agricultural Income tax Act.
[788 A C] On those principles the publication of the general notice in any financial year under section 19(1) of the Assam Act to furnish a 'return o.f one 's agricultural income in the previous year, does not initiate proceedings against an assessee unless such assessee files a return.
If no return is made pursuant to the general notice under section 19(1) assessment could be made against an assessee under section 19(2), serving an individual notice on that assessee during that financial year.
Once that financial year is over, and no return has been made in response to the general notice under section 19(1) and no individual notice has been served under section 19(2), there would arise a case of escaped assessment; and, the only way to bring that income to tax is to initiate proceedings by a notice in accordance with section 30 within 3 years of 781 the end of that financial year.
Since no such proceedings were initiated in the present case, the assessment orders.
were rightly quashed.
