Village P in the State of Andhra Pradesh was originally comprised of a village of the same name and a fairly large hamlet called PP, but in view of the difficulties in the two being treated as one unit for purposes of village administration the Board of Revenue sanctioned the bifurcation of P into two villages, P and PP.
On the division of the village all the hereditary village offices of the original village ceased to exist under section 6(1) of the Madras Hereditary Village Offices Act, 1895, and new offices were created for the two villages.
The section provided, inter alia, that "in choosing persons to fill such new offices the Collector shall select the persons whom he may consider the best qualified from among the families of the last holders of the offices which have been abolished." Though applications for the post of Village Munsif of PP had been invited by the Revenue authorities and the petitioner among others had made the application, respondent 4 who was the son of the Village Munsif of the old village, P, was selected on the ground that in view of section 6(1) of the Act, as the last holder of the office was appointed to the new village, P, after bifurcation, respondent 4 as the son of the last holder and nearest heir had a preferential claim for the post of Village Munsif for PP.
The petitioner challenged the validity of the order of the Revenue authorities on the grounds (1) that the office of Village Munsif was an office under the State, and that the order in favour of 932 respondent 4 which expressly stated that they proceeded on the basis of the hereditary principle laid down in section 6(1) of the Act, discriminated against him as a citizen on the ground of descent only and violated the guarantee of equal opportunity enshrined in article 16 of the Constitution of India, and (2) that section 6(1) of the Act, to the extent that it permitted such discrimination was void under article 13(1) of the Constitution.
The plea of the respondents was (1) that the expression "office under the State" in article 16 had no, reference to an office like that of the Village Munsif which in its origin was a customary village office later recognised and regulated by law, and (2) that article 16 did not apply to a hereditary office because a person entitled to it under the Act had a pre existing right to the office and its emoluments which could be enforced by a suit.
Held: (1) that a village office like that of the Village Munsif was an office under the State within the meaning of article 16 of the Constitution of India; M. Ramappa vs Sangappa and otheys; , 167, referred to.
(2) that a person entitled to an office under section 6(1) of the Madras Hereditary Village Offices Act, 1895, did not have any pre existing right to property in the shape of emoluments of the office, independent or irrespective of the office, and consequently to such an office article 16 applied; and, (3) that section 6(1) of the Act embodied a principle of discrimination on the ground of descent only and was in contravention of article 16(2) of the Constitution.
