The jute carpet backing cloth manufactured by the appel lant in its jute mills and exported was covered by Item 1 in column 2 which specified "goods made of jute not other wise specified" of the Table appended to the Tax Credit Certificate (Exports) Scheme, 1965.
The notification issued by the Central Government in exercise of the powers vested under section 280ZE read with section 280ZC, dated 6 6 1966 and 8 8 1966, provided that no tax credit certificate shall be issued in respect of any goods exported after 5 6 1966.
The appellant, who exported diverse quantities of jute carpet backing cloth manufactured by it to various countries during the period 13 7 1966 and 30 11 1966, filed a writ petition in the Calcutta High Court for a writ of mandamus for quash ing and setting aside both the Notifications and directing the Central Government to consider the application of the applicant for tax credit certificate in respect of the exports without taking into account the two Notifications.
The ground of challenge was that the two Notifications were outside the powers conferred on the Central Government u/s 280ZE read with section 280 ZC, since the Central ' Government had no power under those sections to make a scheme providing that no tax credit certificate shall be granted in case of any goods or merchandise at all.
The single Judge granted mandamus, but the Division Bench on appeal took a different view and negatived the challenge.
Dismissing the appeal by certificate the Court, HELD: (i) The Division Bench of the High Court was right in holding that the Central Government was entitled to issue the two Notifications directing that no tax credit certifi cates shall be granted in respect of goods or merchan dise exported on or after 5 6 1966.
[131 A B] (ii) No obligation can be spelt out from Ss.
280 ZC and 280 ZE requiring the Central Government to frame a scheme specifying the goods or merchandise in respect of which tax credit certificate shall be granted.
The Central Government was entitled to say that having regard to the factors set out in subsection (3) of section 280 ZC, it does not think it desirable that tax credit certificate should be granted in respect of any goods or merchandise for the time being.
