The appellant filed an application under section 26(f) of the Bengal Tenancy Act claiming right of preemption over the land purchased by the respondent.
The respondent took up the position that the appellant was not a co sharer in the land which had been purchased by her and that he along with his uncle had acted as brokers in the transaction and received brokerage; the appellant had thus waived his right of preemption.
The trial Judge allowed the application.
The appeal Court held that the appellant 's claim was barred owing to waiver on his part.
A revision to the High Court was unsuccessful.
In appeal to this Court it was urged that waiver could be brought about only by a contract and since no consideration had passed it could not be said that there had been any waiver.
HELD, : Under the Indian Law neither consideration nor an agreement would be necessary to constitute waiver.
A waiver signifies nothing more than an intention not to insist upon the right.
It is well known that in the law of preemption the general principle which can be said to have been uniformly adopted by the Indian courts is that acquiescence in the sale by any positive act amounting to relinquishment of a preemptive right has the effect of forfeiture of such a right.
So far as the law of preemption is concerned the principle of waiver is based mainly on Mohammedan Jurisprudence.
The contention that the waiver of the appellant 's right under section 26F of the Bengal Tenancy Act must be founded on contrast or agreement cannot therefore be acceded to.
