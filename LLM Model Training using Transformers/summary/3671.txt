The Haryana High Court invited applications and interviewed candidates for filling up vacancies in the quota of direct recruits from the bar, in the Haryana Superior Judicial Service.
The names of the appellants were recommended to the State Government who rejected them and asked the High Court to invite application again.
Accepting the position, the High Court issued the advertisements.
The appellants filed petitions against the order rejecting their names and asked for mandamus for appointment.
The same were dismissed by the High Court on the ground that the appellants had no locus standi.
Dismissing the appeals, the Court, HELD: (1) There must be a judicially enforceable right as well as a legally protected right before one suffering a legal grievance can ask for a mandamus.
A person can be said to be aggrieved only when he is denied a legal right by some one who has legal duty to do something or to abstain from doing something.
