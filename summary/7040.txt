Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1.
In an appeal arising from an order of acquittal, the appellate Court is not precluded from appreciating the evidences on its own if the reasons given by the learned trial Judge in passing the order of acquittal, do not stand scrutiny and are against the weight of the evidences adduced in the trial.
The appellate Court, will be quite justified in setting aside the order of acquittal if it appears to the court of appeal that improper consideration of the materials and evidences on record was made and the reasonings of the trial Judge are wholly unjustified.
It is only necessary that the court of appeal should weigh the reasonings of the learned trial Judge with care and caution in the light of the evidences adduced in the case by giving cogent reasons as to why such findings are unreasonable and against the evidence.
[451B C] 2.01.
In the instant case, the High Court has taken care in analysing each and every finding of the learned Sessions Judge in the light of the evidences adduced in the case and has given cogent reasons as to why such findings were unreasonable and not acceptable.
It is an admitted position that two persons suffered gun shot injuries and one of the enjured persons died on the spot and the other was removed to hospital.
He got serious injuries and later on sccummbed to such injuries.
The mere fact that there was enmity and bitterness between the two groups, by itself, does not establish that the eye witnesses falsely implicated the accused/appellant.
[451D E] 2.02.
There are no intrinsic discrepancies in the evidences of the eye witnesses.
Even if it is assumed that such eye witnesses belong to the group of the complainant, their evidences are not liable to be discarded on that score if such evidences otherwise inspire confidence and get cor roborated by other evidences and from the nature of injuries, sustained by the deceased persons.
[452E] 2.03.
All the findings made by the Sessions Judge were considered in detail by the High Court and the findings of the learned Sessions judge were not accepted by the High Court by indicating that such findings were 447 against the weight of the evidences and the same were wholly unreasonable.
In the circumstances, there is no reason to take a contrary view in this appeal.
