The lands of the respondent and other land owners were acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
Notifications under sections 4 and 6 of the Act were published on 10.5.1979 and 27.3.1981 respectively.
The respondent and other land owners filed Reference Applications u/s 18 of the Act against the award before the District Judge.
The District Judge classifying the acquired land into various grades awarded compensation and also granted bene fits u/s 23(1 A) of the Act to the respondent and other land Owners.
Hence, the State appealed to the High Court.
Those land owners, who were not satisfied with the compensation awarded and those to whom benefit u/s 23(1 A) were not granted, also appealed to the High Court.
The Single Judge of the High Court confirmed the grant of benefits u/s 23(1 A) of the Act and also granted such benefits to those cases, where such benefits were not given by the District Judge.
The State preferred the Letters Patent Appeals before the Division Bench of the High Court, contending that the respondent and 479 other land owners were not entitled to the benefit of sec tion 23(1 A) of the Act; that the section 23(1 A) was intro duced by the Land Acquisition(Amendment) Act, 1984; that as the Collector had made his award on 31.3.1981 the provisions of section 23(1 A) of the Act was not applicable to the cases of the respondent and other land owners.
The Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the Letters Patent Appeals of the State.
Hence the present appeals by special leave were filed by the State before this Court.
The parties before this Court made the same submissions which were made before the High Court.
Dismissing the appeal, (CA No.4568 of 1991) this Court, HELD: 1.
A perusal of the provisions of sub section(1 A) of section 23 makes it clear that the said sub section deals with substantive rights and it confers a substantive right to claim the additional amount calculated as set out in the said sub section in the circumstances set out therein.
Similarly, sub section(2) of Section 23 also confers a substantive right on the claimant to a higher solatium.
[486 E F] 2.
The provisions of the Act, being substantive in nature, can have only prospective application unless the language in which the provisions are couched, read in the context, shows that the intention of the legislature was to give retrospective effect to them.
The language of sub section(1 A) of section 23 shows that a duty is cast on the court to award an amount calculated as stated therein in addition to the market value of the land acquired for the period commencing from the date of the publication of sec tion 4 of the Notification to the date of the award of the Collector or the date of taking possession, whichever is earlier.
[486 F G] 3.
The expression "award" used in section 23(1 A) suggests that the intention of the legislature was to make the provisions of the said sub section applicable to cases where the Collector had yet to make his award or the Trial Court hearing the Reference under Section 18 of the Land acquisition Act has still to make its award after the coming into force of the said sub section on September 30, 1984.
[486 H 487 A] 480 4.
The expression "award" is to be distinguished from the expression "decree" and hence, it appears that in the absence of any contrary or inconsistent provision in the Act the provisions of subsection(1 A) of section 23 would not come into play where the awards had been made by the Collec tor earlier as well as by the Reference Court but on the date of coming into effect of the said sub section, an appeal from the said award might have been pending in a court.
In that case, the court would not be "awarding" any amount but would be making a "decree" for an amount.
[487 B C] 5.
By reason of the provision of section 30(1)(a) of the Amendment Act of 1984 the provisions of section 23(1 A) of the Act were, by a deeming provision, made also applica ble to every proceeding for the acquisition of land under the Act where the Collector had not made his award by.
April, 30,1982.
On a correct interpretation of the provisions of section 23(1 A) read with section 30(1)(a) of the Amendment Act of 1984, an additional amount calculated in the manner indicated in section 23(1 A) is also payable in those cases where the Collector had not made his award on or before April 30,1982, but the Court might have made its award before September 24,1984.
[487 D E] 6.
The construction that is being given to the provi sions of section 23(1 A) and section 30(1)(a) will, in a sense, limit the benefits strictly conferred by section 30(1)(a) to only those cases, where the Collector as well as the Court have made their respective awards between April 30,1982 and September 24, 1984.
That cannot be helped, as that is the result of the plain grammatical construction of the clear language used in the relevant provisions.
[487 E F] 7.
The Court would not be justified in giving an unduly restricted meaning to the provisions of section 23(1 A) unwarranted by the plain language of the sub section.
[487 F] 8.
Section 23(1 A) refers clearly to the duties of the court.
The court is defined by section 3(d) as the principal court of original jurisdiction, except in the circumstances set out in the said subsection, which would be the court having jurisdiction to decide the reference under section 18 of the Act.
There, is therefore, no warrant to read in the place of the word "Court" in Section 23(1 A) the word "Collector".
Moreover, the decision of such a court deter mining compensation is regarded as an award under the Act.
In the light of the provisions, there is no warrant to give an unduly restricted meaning to section 23(1 A) of the Act.
[487 G 488 A] 481 9.
On the plain language of section 23(1 A) itself, the duty was cast on the court to award an additional amount calculated as prescribed therein which would mean that such amount is directed to be awarded by the court, namely, the Reference court, in all cases which are pending before that court on September 1, 1984.
Sub section (1)(a) of Section 30 lays down that the provisions of section 23(1 A) of the Act are also made applicable to all proceedings for the acquisi tion of any land under the said Act pending on April 30,1982, where no award had been made by the Collector before that date.
At first glance this would appear to suggest that the additional amount referred to in section 23(1 A) could not be awarded where the Collector had made his award before April 30,1982.
But this provision cannot be allowed to cut down the benefits available to the claimants on a plain reading of section 23(t A).
This is clear from the use of the word "also" in the opening part of section 30(1).
[489 E H] 10.
In the present case as the Reference court has made its award after September 24,1984 the benefit of the provi sions of Section 23(1 A) was clearly available to the claim ant.
