The land in suit was Khoti land land section 9 of the Khoti Settlement Act, 1880, prior to its amendment prohibited the. transfer of the occupancy right without the consent of the Khot.
Section 31 of the Bombay Tenancy Act, 1939, which came into force from April 1946, amended section 9 of the Khoti Settlement Act by which no consent of the Khot was necessary for transferring the occupancy rights in the land.
In 1892, R sold his occupancy right without the consent of tile Khot to L, the predecessor in interest of respondent No. 1.
In 1945, R 's successor again sold the same occupancy right to the appellant also without the consent of the Khot.
The appellant 's case was that the sale deed in 1892 in favour of the predecessor in interest of respondent No. 1 was void as the transfer of the occupancy right was made without consent of the Khot; whereas respondent No. 1 contended that R by the sale deed in 1892 had already lost his right to the property in suit and therefore R 's successors had no title to pass in 1945 in favour of the appellant.
Held, that the occupancy right in a Khoti land could not be transferred without consent of the Khot prior to April 1946, when the Bombay Tenancy Act, 1939, came into force 114 906 Held, further, that in the present case as both the sales of 1892 and 1945 were without the consent of the Khot, it was not necessary to determine whether such a transfer was void or voidable, If void, the plaintiff had no title.
If voidable, the first sale in 1892, validly conveyed title to respondent No 1 's predecessor in interest, and consequently no title passed to the plaintiff under the sale deed in 1945, as the transferor had no title.
