The members of a Ghee and Tel Brokers Association, used to enter into contracts for the sale and purchase of groundnut oil.
Week after week contracts were cancelled by cross transactions and there was no delivery.
Instead of payment of price losses resulting from the cross transactions were deposited by the operators in loss with the Association.
On the due date also there was no delivery but adjustment of all contracts of sales against all contracts of purchase between the same parties and delivery was of the outstanding balance.
Even this delivery was often avoided by entering into fresh contract at the rate prevailing on the due date, as part of the. transactions in the next period.
The Sessions Judge convicted the respondents the Association 's President, Secretary and Directors.
holding that these were forward contracts prohibited under the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act and the Association was not recognised.
The High Court set aside the convictions.
In appeal, this Court: HELD: Section 18(1) of the Act speaks of true non transferable 'specific delivery contracts but the proviso at the same time makes it illegal for an unrecognised association to so arrange matters that non transferable specific delivery contracts will be worked out without actual delivery.
Such conduct is prohibited by the proviso and directly punishable under section 20(1)(b).
An offence under that clause of section 20(1) and also under el.
(c3 of that section read with section 15 was made out.
There was no question of considering the matter first under the main part of the first sub section and then to put the proviso out of the way because the first sub section did not apply.
The Legislature contemplates that the first sub section of section 18 might be complied with in the documents evidencing the contract but in actuality the contract might be differently performed and has.
therefore, provided for the identical situation which arose in this case.
