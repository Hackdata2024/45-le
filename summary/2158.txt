The appellants through their karta had an open mutual and current account with the respondent bank.
They borrowed from the bank and also paid monies into it.
On March 1, 1947 a sum of Rs. 15,956/7 was due to the bankfrom the appellants.
In order to pay off that amount a mortgage deedwas executed by the appellants in favour of the bank.
Under that deedfurther amounts up to a limit of Rs. 16,000 could be advanced to the appellants against the security mentioned therein.
According to the bank, under the said provision of the deed a further sum of Rs. 10,000 was advanced to the appellants on March19, 1947.On April 9, 1953 the bank filed a suit for the recovery ofsums due to it from the appellants and the suit was claimed to be withinthe period of limitation on the allegation that on November 24, 1949, the appellants had repaid a sum of Rs. 100 to the bank.
The appellants denied that they had borrowed Rs. 10,000 as alleged or that they had repaid Rs. 100.
The trial court decreed the suit of the bank and the High Court upheld the decree.
The appellants then came to this Court by special leave.
The questions that fell for determination were (i) whether by producing a copy of the entry relating to the loan of Rs. 10,000 in these account books the bank had proved the said loan, (ii) whether the suit was within time.
HELD : (i) In view of section 34 of the Evidence Act the appellants could not be saddled with liability for the sum of Rs. 10,000 said to have been advanced to them on March 19.
1947 on the basis of a mere entry in the account.
Section 34 says that such entry alone shall not be suffi cient evidence and so some independent evidence had to be given by the bank to show that this sum was advanced.
Such evidence not having been given the claim could not be upheld.
[903 C] (ii)Section 4 of the Bankers ' Books Evidence Act (18 of 1891) certainly gives a special privilege to banks and allows certified copies of their accounts to be produced by them and those certified copies become prima facie evidence of the existence of the original entries in the accounts and are admitted as evidence of matters, transactions, and accounts therein.
But such admission is only where and to the extent as the original entry itself would be admissible by law and not further or otherwise.
Original entries alone under section 34 of the Evidence Act would not be sufficient to charge any person with liability and as such, copies produced under section 4 of the Bankers ' Books Evidence Act could not charge any person with liability.
[902 C E] (iii)The suit was clearly within time insofar as the liability for sale under the mortgage deed was concerned as it was filed within 12 years of the execution of the mortgage as allowed by article 138 of the Limitation Act of 1908.
[903 G] 899 As to the personal liability under the deed that was beyond time as the suit was filed more than six years after the execution of the mortgage allowed by article 116.
The entry of the payment of Rs. 100 in the accounts also did, not help the bank in this behalf.
That entry was of no value under section 19 or section 20 of the Limitation Act for neither a writing signed by the appellants nor an acknowledgement of payment in the handwriting of the appellants or in a writing signed by them had been proved.
Nor did article 85 help the bank in fixing personal, responsibility on the appellants as the time of three years allowed by that Article had ended before the filing of the suit.
