Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court ^ HELD: The statement by the dying tragic woman that her husband should not be beaten, even though she was dying having been burnt, cannot be converted into one exculpative of the accused.
This is a sentiment too touching for tears and stems from the values of the culture of the Indian womanhood.
[1210A B] Observation: Police sensitisation mechanisms which will prevent commission of crimes like wife burning must be set up if these horrendous crimes are to be avoided.
Likewise, special provisions facilitating easier proof of such special class of murders on establishing certain basic facts must be provided for by appropriate legislation.
Law must rise to the challenge of shocking criminology, especially when helpless women are the victims and the crime is committed in the secrecy of the husband 's home.
