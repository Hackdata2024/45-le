The assessee mill claimed deduction under section 10(2) (xv) of the Indian Income tax Act of the expenses incurred by it and the costs awarded to Government in respect of unsuccessful writ petition and appeals therefrom.
The deduction was disallowed by the departmental authorities, and the question was answered against the assessee by the High Court.
In appeals to this Court.
HELD: The appeal must be allowed.
The proceeding started by the assessee was in relation to the business of the assessee.
Expenditure incurred to resist in a civil proceeding the enforcement of a measure legislative or executive, which imposes restrictions on the carrying on of a business or to obtain a declaration that the measure is invalid would. if other conditions are satisfied, be admissible under section 10(2) (xv) as a permissible deduction in the computation of taxable income, even though the expenditure does not directly relate to the earning of income.
Expenditure may not be denied admission as a permissible deduction in computing the taxable income merely because the proceeding has failed.
Persistence of the assessee in launching the proceeding and carrying it from Court to Court and incurring expenditure for that purpose again cannot be a ground for disallowing the claim.
