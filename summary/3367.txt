The assessee appellant received in October, 1953, a sum of Rs, 9,95,000/ out of Rs. 10,00,000 compensation for the premature termination of its managing agency business, a sum of Rs. 5,000/ , having been deducted towards brokerage.
The said amount was credited to the Capital Reserve Account in its books for the year ending on June 30, 1954 described as "compensation for loss of office".
In the assessment year 1955 56, for which, the appellant 's previous year ended on June 30, 1954, the Income Tax Officer assessed the entire amount of Rs. 10,00,000 in the hands of the appellant company under section 10 (5A).
The Company preferred an appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who allowed the appeal holding that (i) section 10(5A) created a new source of income for which the previous year was not the previous year for the managing agency business ending on June 30, 1954; (ii) the compensation of Rs. 10,00,0000 which the assessee received in October, 1953 fell in the financial year 1953 54 ` which would be the previous year for this income for which the assessment year was 1954 55, which was before the enactment of sub section SA of section 10; (iii) the fact that the appellant had entered the amount in its books for the year that ended on June 30, 1954, could not be taken as an exercise of option by the assessee, accepting the said year as the previous year in respect of the receipt; and (iv) if at all the amount was taxable in the assessment year 1955 56, the assessee was entitled to a deduction of Rs. 6,00,000/ paid for acquiring the managing agency.
The appeal preferred by the Department was partly allowed.
Tho Tribunal agreed with the Appellate Assistant Commissioner that the assessee was entitled to a deduction of Rs. which the assessee had paid for acquiring the managing agency business.
The Tribunal however held that Sec. 10 (5A) does not increase a fresh source of income that since tho amount in question was received in the accounting year relevant to the assessment year 1955 56 it was taxable in the assessment year 1955 56; The High Court on a reference under section 66(1) of the Act on the two questions namely (i) Whether the sum of Rs. 10 lakhs is income assessable in the year 1955 56 by virtue of Section 10(5A)? and (ii) If the answer is in the affirmative, whether the initial cost of acquisition of the Mananging Agency of Rs. 6 lakhs and Rs. 5 thousands paid as brokerage on sale are deductible ? agreed with the views of the Tribunal.
On appeal by certificate under section 66A(2) and dismissing the appeal, the Court, ^ HELD: (1) Since sub section 5A of section 10 came into force on April 1, 1955, the amount in question if received by the assessee during the previous year for the assessment year 1955 56, would be taxable under that sub section.
By 774 a legal fiction introduced by the sub section, any amount received by a managing agent as compensation for the termination of his managing agency agreement which would otherwise have been a capital receipt is to be deemed as profit and gains of a business carried on by the managing agent.
The fiction regards the capital receipt as income and does not extend to treating the termination of managing agency itself as a business.
The amount received by the appellant was the payment for the termination of the managing agency business and, as such, the receipt is obviously related to that business.
Though the amount was not earned in carrying on the business of managing agency, yet the source of the receipt was the mananing agency business itself, it is not therefore correct to say that the receipt was income from a new and independent source (2) The High Court was right in holding that in enacting sub section 5A, the Legislature was concerned only with providing a head under which the or receipt which has been deemed to be income could be brought to tax and was not concerned with creating a new source fur that deemed income.
[777G] (3) The compensation paid for the termination of a managing agency business is a payment in relation to the said business and, therefore, the previous year relevant to that receipt would be the same as the previous year for the managing agency business itself.
