100 bights of land lying unused were requisitioned by Government to settle landless people.
The appellant, a tea planter, willingly surrendered the same.
But, when the State proceeded to acquire the land under section 7(1A) of ' the Assam Land (Requisition and Acquisition) Act, 1948 he disputed the payment of lesser scale of compensation prescribed under section 7(1A) of the Act. 'The Courts below concurrently held against him.
Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: The simple statutory test that settles the issue is lo find out whether the land acquired is Lying fallow or uncultivated.
If it is, a small compensation alone is awardable, as laid down in section 7(1A) of the Act.
On the other hand, if it is tea garden, the quantum is as under section 23 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
Plethora of evidence adduced in this case clearly proceeds on the basis that the land in question is fallow.
The High Court has, therefore, rightly held that section 7(1A) appropriately applied to this case.
