Dismissing the petition, the Court ^ HELD: 1.
Whatever be the guidelines observed for the exercise of the power conferred by Article 72 of the Constitution.
the only sentence which can, possibly be imposed upon the petitioner in The instant case, is that of death and no circumstances exist for interference with that sentence.
Not even tho most liberal use of his mercy jurisdiction could have persuaded tho President to interfere with the sentence of death imposed upon the petitioner in view particularly of the considerations mentioned in KS.
Ranga vs Union of India and Anr., [1981] 3 S.C R. 512.
Therefore, in refusing to commute the sentence the death imposed upon the petitioner into a lesser sentence the President has not in any manner transgressed his discretionary power under Article 72.
[59 D E, 60 B C] 2.
Undoubtedly, the President has the power in an appropriate case to commute any sentence imposed by Court into a lesser sentence.
But tho question as to whether the case is appropriate for the exercise of the power conferred by Article 72 depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
[59 E, G] 3.
After all the power conferred by Article 72 can be used only for the purpose of reducing the sentence, not for enhancing it.
Therefore, no useful purpose will be achieved by the petitioner by ensuring the imposition of any severe, judicially evolved constraints on the wholesome power of the President to use it as the justice of a case may require.
