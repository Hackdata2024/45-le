The Appellant was ordered to be evicted under section 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 on the ground of bona fide requirement of the landlord.
Dismissing the Appeal, to this Court, HELD: 1.
Sections 14A, 14(e), 25A, 25B and 25C of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, are special provisions so far as the landlord and tenant are concerned and further in view of the non obstante clause in the section these provisions over ride the existing law so far as the new procedure is concerned.
Therefore, the Slum Areas (Improvement and Clear ance) Act, 1956, would have no application in cases covered by sections 14A and 14(1)(e) of the Rent Act especially in view of the provisions which were added by the Amending Act of 1976.
[690D F] 2.
There is no difference either on principle or in law between section 14(1)(e) and 14A of the Rent Act even though these two provisions relate to eviction of tenants under different situations.
[690F] 3.
In view of the procedure in Chapter III A of the Rent Act, the Slum Act is rendered inapplicable to the extent of inconsistency and it is not necessary for the landlord to obtain permission of the Competent Authority under section 19(1)(a) of the Slum Act before instituting a suit for eviction and coming within section 14(1)(e) or 14A of the Rent Act.
