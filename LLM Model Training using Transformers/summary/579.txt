The appellants claimed bonus for the years 1950, 1951 and 1952 at the rate of six months ' wages per year.
The Industrial Tribunal to which the dispute was referred allowed, in calculating the surplus available for payment of bonus, inter alia return on paid up capital and on the reserves at 7% and 5% respectively and accepted the " unit scheme " of payment of bonus which the company had been following since 1926.
Under this scheme units were credited to each workman taking into consideration the importance of the job he held, the wages he got and the number of years he had been employed in that particular job, and each workman was paid bonus in proportion to the units to his credit.
On appeal the Labour Appellate Tribunal modified the award and raised the return on the reserves from 5% to 6% : Held, that the formula laid down in Sree Meenakski Mills vs Their workmen, ([1958] S.C.R. 878 at 884) for ascertaining the surplus on the basis of which bonus becomes determinable and distributable could be applied to the tea industry with suitable adjustments.
The allowing Of 7% return on capital as against 6% held allowable under that formula was justified by the additional risk factors in the tea industry.
The allowing Of 5% return on reserves by the Industrial Tribunal as against 4% allowed by the formula was not unreasonable, it being sufficient to safeguard the interests of the company.
But the increasing of this to 6% by the Appellate Tribunal was insupportable in the absence of any claim in the respondent 's written statement for rehabilitation or ,of any figures for determining this amount.
The " unit scheme " was suitable for the payment of bonus and would result not only in the fair distribution of bonus but would also lead to improvement in the quality and quantity of work.
