The City of Bangalore Municipal Corporation Services (General) Cadre and Recruitment Regulations, 1971, framed under the City of Bangalore Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, came into force on 3rd March,1971.
In accordance with the ' practice of the Corporation prevailing before that date to have one half of the cadre of Senior Health Inspec tors manned by deputation of Senior Health Inspectors from the Karnataka State Civil Service, the appellants were taken on deputation by the Corporation from the Karnataka State Civil Service.
In 1974, the Corporation passed a resolution that the appellants would be absorbed by the Corporation if they were willing to accept their ranking as juniors to the Senior Health Inspectors of the Corporation, and the State Government accorded its sanction to the resolution of the Corporation as required by the Act.
But coming to know that the chances of promotion of the permanent officials of the Corporation would be prejudicially affected by such absorp tion, the State Government withdrew its sanction accorded earlier.
The appellants preferred writ petitions for quashing the withdrawn but the High Court dismissed the petitions.
In appeal to this Court, it was contended that the appellants became permanent employees of the Corporation and ceased to be Government servants as soon as the State Gov ernment accorded sanction to the Resolution of the Corpora tion and that therefore, the State Government could not, thereafter, by its unilateral action, reverse the process and annihilate the relationship of employer and employee between the Corporation and the.
appellants and restore their status as Government servants.
Dismissing the appeals, HELD : (1) The Resolution read with the Government sanction did not operate to put an end to the status of the appellants as government servant and to create the rela tionship of master and servant between the Corporation and the appellants, and therefore, it was competent to the State Government to withdraw the sanction accorded earlier; and this would be so irrespective of whether the appellants expressed their willingness to be absorbed as SeniOr Health Inspectors by the Corporation or not.
[797 BC] (a) Regulation 3 of the Regulations which were in force when the Resolution was passed by the Corporation recognised only two modes of recruitment to the post of Senior Health Inspectors namely, by promotion from the cadre of Junior Health Inspectors and by deputation.
Therefore, to absorb Senior Health Inspectors from the State Directorate of Health Services as permanent employees of the Corporation would be plainly contrary to the express mandate of this statutory provision.
[796 C & F] (b) It could not be urged that because they were already on deputation in the cadre of Senior Health Inspectors under the Corporation, their absorption as permanent Senior Health Inspectors did not constitute fresh entry into the cadre so as to require compliance with the Regulations.
Not only 792 their entry but also their continuance in the cadre of Senior Health Inspectors on the Corporation establishment depended on their being on deputation, because, it is only by way of deputation that Senior Health Inspectors from the State Directorate of Health Services can find place in the cadre of Senior Health Inspectors on the establishment of the Corporation Since absorption is appointment, without amendment of the Regulations permitting appointment of Senior Health Inspectors drawn from the State Directorate of Health Services as permanent Senior Health Inspectors under the Corporation, the appellants could not be absorbed on the Corporation Establishment.
