(ii) The plea that A was mistaken for V would not take away the common intention established by a pre arranged plan and participation of all the accused in furtherance of common intention.
The act might be done by one of the several persons in furtherance of the common intention of them all without each one of them having intended to do the particular act in exactly the same way as an act might be done by one member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common intention which the other members of the unlawful assembly did not each intend to be don. .
[36 H] On the facts, it was clear that the attack took place in pursuance of a pre arranged plan.
, The attack by appellants 1 and 2 on A and the evidence showing that appellant 3 held back P during the attack all proved common intention, participation and united criminal behaviour of all; appellant 3 was therefore equally responsible and guilty with appellants 1 and 2 who had attacked A.

vs State of Gujarat, ; ; referred to.
The dominant feature of section 34 is the element of participation in actions.
This participation need not in all cases be by physical presence.
Common intention implies acting in concert.
There is a pre arranged plan which is proved either from conduct or from circumstances or from incriminating facts.
The principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act is embodied in section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
The existence of common intention is to be the basis of liability.
That is why the prior concert and the pre arranged plan is the foundation of common intention to establish liability and guilt.
