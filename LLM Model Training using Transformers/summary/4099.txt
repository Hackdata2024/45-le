Section 24(2)(iii) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 as it stood in 1955 provided that a business loss which was not wholly set off should be carried forward from year to year.
In consequence of an amendment to the section made in 1957 the carry forward of unabsorbed loss could not be effected for more than eight years.
After setting off unabsorbed losses for the assessment years 1949 50 and 1950 51 the Income Tax officer directed that the loss remaining unabsorbed in the year 1950 51 be carried forward.
The assessee 's plea that the unabsorbed loss of the year 1950 51 should be set off against the business income of the assessment year 1960.61 was rejected by the Income Tax officer on the ground that the unabsorbed loss of the year 1950 51 could not be carried forward for more than eight years.
The assessee was unsuccessful in appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Appellate Tribunal.
The High Court answered the reference against the Assessee.
In appeal to this Court it was contended that by virtue of section 24(2) (iii) of the Act, as it stood before its amendment in 1957, the assessee had acquired a vested right to have the unabsorbed loss carried forward from year to year until it was completely set off and that the subsequent amendment limiting the period to eight years could not divest the assessee of the vested right already accrued to him.
Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: The unabsorbed loss of the assessment year 1950 51 could not be carried forward for more than eight years and consequently could not be set off against the business income of the assessment year 1960 61.

(a) It is a cardinal principle of the tax law that the law to be applied is that in force in the assessment year unless otherwise provided expressly or by necessary implication right claimed by an assessee under the law in force In a particular assessment year is ordinarily available only in relation to a proceeding pertaining to that years.

907 (b) When an assessment for the assessment year 1960 61 was to be made A and section 24(2) was invoked it was the section in force as ill that assessment year which had to be applied.
There is no question of the assessee possessing any vested right under the law as it stood before the amendment.

The direction of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner that the unabsorbed loss should be carried forward have meaning only if the law in force in the relevant assessment year permits the unabsorbed loss to be carried forward into the assessment of that year the instant case the Appellate Assistant Commissioner assumed that the law permitted the unabsorbed loss to be carried forward into future year.
But that was not the law in the relevant assessment year and therefore the assessee could derive no advantage from that direction.
