The appellant company owned jute mills situated in Raigarh in the State of Madhya Pradesh, and it had to bring raw material from many railway booking stations outside the State as there was no other means of transport both for bringing jute to the mills and for carrying the finished products to ports for export to foreign countries; the jute mills in West Bengal and Madras had facilities for direct shipment of their goods without carriage by rail to the ports, and so the prices of the products of the appellant could not be brought down to the competitive level for the purposes of export out of, or sale in, India.
The appellant filed a complaint before the Railway Rates Tribunal under section 41 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890, on the allegations that the Railway administration had contravened the provisions of section 28 of the Act in that it had offered special rates for certain stations in its zone to Kanpur which were cheaper than those that were charged between Raigarh and some other railway stations, and that the charges levied for the freight of the appellant 's goods were unreasonable and excessive.
The Tribunal found that competition between the goods of the Kanpur mills and the appellant 's goods had not been alleged or proved in the present case Held, that the mere fact that the goods of the Kanpur mills are transported at more favourable rates would not attract the provisions of section 28 of the Act, unless there is competition between the goods of the Kanpur mills and the appellant 's goods, and undue preference has been shown by the railway administration to the appellant 's competitor.
Nitshill and Lesmahagow Coal Company vs The Caladonian Railway Company, (1874) 11 Railway and Canal Traffic Cases, 39, Denaby Main Colliery Company vs Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Company, , Lancashire Patent Fuel Company Limited vs London and North Western Railway Company, (1904) XII Railway and Canal Traffic Cases, 77 and Lever Brothers, Limited vs Midland Railway Company, (1909) XIII Railway and Canal Traffic Cases, 301, relied on.
Held, further, that in considering the question as to the reasonableness of the railway freight the relevant factors would mainly be the working costs of the railway administration and 237 other material circumstances, and neither the geographical location of the appellant on account of which it has to incur additional expenses of transport, nor the cost incurred in producing the jute goods nor the commodity prices prevailing in the market, have any relevance.
