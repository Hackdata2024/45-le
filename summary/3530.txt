The Chief Justice of the High Court also examined the evidence on his own, and confirming the findings of the Enquiry Officer, recommended compulsory retirement.
Both reports were sent to the Government, and a show cause notice with the Enquiry Officer 's report was issued to the respondent.
Later, with the Public Service Commission 's approval, the respondent was compulsorily retired.
His appeal to the Rajpramukh was dismissed, but the City Civil Court and High Court decided in his favour.
The question before this Court was, whether the Chief Jus tice 's report was in accordance with the Hyderabad Civil Service (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules and the High Court Act, and whether the failure to communicate it to the respondent, amounted to a denial of reasonable opportu nity for defending himself at the stages of enquiry and punishment.
Dismissing the appeal, the Court, HELD: (1) The report of the Chief Justice of the pro posed punishment of compulsory retirement took into consid eration extraneous matters, and he was not authorised to do so under the Rules, or the High Court Act.
The report was based, to a large extent, oh secret information which the respondent had no opportunity of meeting.
[132 D E] (2) The Government accepted the Chief Justice 's report and took action on it.
The report was not given to the respondent.
