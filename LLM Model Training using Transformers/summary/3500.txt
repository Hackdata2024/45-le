The appellant challenged under article 226 the reasonableness of the increase in the telephone rental and call charges brought about by the Indian Telegraph Amendment Rules.
1966 on the ground that (1) The telephone system is a public utility service and the charges can be only in the nature of a fee which must be commensurate with the cost of rendering the service; and (2) The loss incurred by the Government in another establishment service is not a legitimate ground for raising the rates.
The writ petition was accepted and on appeal the judgment was reversed holding that (1) the High Court could not interfere with the tariff.
and (2 ) the principle upon which the public utility rates regulation as developed in the United States is not applicable in our country.
Dismissing the appeal by certificate, the Court, ^ HELD: (I) The courts have no jurisdiction under Article 226 to go into the reasonableness of rates.
These rates are decided as policy matters in fiscal planning.
There is legislative prescription of rates.
Rates are a matter for legislative judgment and not for judicial determination.
