While this appeal by special leave, relating to an industrial dispute was pending in this Court a Director of the appellant employer and a representative of the respondents employees made an application to the Court praying that an order might be passed in terms of a compromise since an agreement was alleged to have been entered into by the appellants and the respondents.
Some of the respondents contested this compromise and the court sent issues to the Tribunal for finding whether the alleged com promise actually took place between the parties, and if so, was it valid.
The Tribunal returned findings to the effect that the compromise did actually take place and was valid.
Those findings were contested in the appeal.
Held, that a compromise agreement seeking to settle an industrial dispute which was still pending decision in this Court would not contravene the provisions of section 23 of the Payment of Wages Act which contemplated rights not likely to be modified or reversed in any judicial proceedings.
The procedure prescribed by section 6 C of the U. P. and the provisions thereof did not affect the powers of this Court, or the competence of the parties, to amicably settle a dispute pending before it.
The procedure for obtaining an order in terms of the com promise entered into between the parties pending the appeal in this Court is prescribed by its own rules and the provisions of section 2(t) of the U. P. and rule 5(1) of the Rules made thereunder have no application to such case.
