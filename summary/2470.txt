In pursuance of the clause in the contract which provided that in the event of any question or dispute arising under the. contract or in connection with the contract it should be referred to arbitration, the dispute was so referred.
One of the items in dispute was a 'claim by the respondent that there was an excess supply of timber to cover up possible rejection, which should be returned by the appellant with compensation for deterioration, or that payment should be made for it at the market value.
The appellant contended that the terms of the contract did not require the respondent to tender for inspection an,of quantity in excess of the contracted quantity, that the claim was in detinue relating to an involuntary bailment and not in relation to anything done in the performance, implementation or execution of the contract; and therefore.
, it was not a dispute arising out of the contract or in connection with the contract.
On the question whether the arbitrators had jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the claim, HELD: The test for determing the question is whether recourse to the contract, by which both the parties are hound, was necessary for the purpose of determining whether the claim of the respondent was justified or otherwise.
Since it was necessary to have recourse to the terms of the, contract for the purpose of deciding the matter in dispute, the matter was within the scope of the arbitration clause and the arbitrators had jurisdiction to decide it.
