The assessee 's year of account was the calendar year. 'The. dividend was sought to be taxed in the assessment year 1950 51, but the assessee contended that: (1) the dividend income was exempt from tax under section 14(2)(c), as it stood in the year of assessment; and (2) that it must be deemed to have been received by the assessee even on July 25, 1949, on which date the assessee was a non resident.
HELD: (1) On December 1, 1949, by merger, the State of Benares became part of the taxable territories as defined in section 2(14 A) of the Act.
Hence, though the dividend might have accrued in an Indian State, it was received by the assessee in the taxable territories on December 31, 1949, and, by the express words in section 14(2)(c), as modified by the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, the dividend income was not exempt from tax liability.
