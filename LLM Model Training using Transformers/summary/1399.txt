The respondents were charged and tried at the same trial with the offences of Criminal conspiracy and breach of trust committed in pursuance thereof during a period of more than one year.
The question arising for decision was whether, in the framing of the charge, contravention of the provisions of sub s.(2) of s.222 which allowed a combined charge with respect to the amount embezzled within a period of one year, vitiated the trial.
^ Held, that the defect in the charge did not lead to any prejudice to the accused and therefore did not vitiate the trial in view of the provision of section 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
When all the offences committed in pursuance of a conspiracy are committed in course of the same transaction this can be tried together at one trial in view of section 235(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provides that if in one 712 series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged with and tried at one trial for every such offence.
