The defendant had obtained certain premises on lease under a deed which contained a covenant by the lessee "not to assign the demised premises or any part thereof without first obtaining the written consent of the lessor, such consent, however, not to be unreasonably withheld in the ease of respectable or responsible person ".
After some offers and counter offers the plaintiff finally made an offer to purchase the defendant 's leasehold interest on certain terms one of which was that "the consent of the landlord will be obtained by you before the completion of the sale "; and the offer was unconditionally accepted by the defendant.
The defendant subsequently refused to assign on the ground that the lessor had withheld his consent, and the plaintiff sued for specific performance of the agree ment: Held, (i) that the agreement was not, for its coming into being, conditional or contingent on the obtaining of the lessor 's consent, the obligation to obtain the lessor 's consent being only a term of the agreement which the defend ant had to fulfil; (ii) the words "such consent, however, not to be unreasonably withheld in the case of a respectable or responsible person" in the leasedeed did not amount to a separate or independent covenant by the lessor that he would not refuse consent except on reasonable grounds in the case of a respectable or responsible person, but only limited or qualified the leesee 's covenant not to assign with.
out the lessor 's consent, by relieving him from the burden of the covenant if the lessor withheld his consent unreasonably in the case of proposed assignment to a respectable or respon sible person ; (iii) that, as the plaintiff was admittedly a respectable and responsible person and on the facts of the case the lessor 's refusal to give consent was unreasonable, the defendant could validly assign the lease without such consent; (iv) that the court could come to a decision on this matter even though the lessor was not a party to the suit and the decision might not bind him; (v) that the defendant could not under these circumstances plead the absence of the lessor 's consent as relieving him from the obligation to perform his part of the agreement if the plaintiff insisted on his carrying out the agreement even though the lessor had not given his consent; and the plain tiff was therefore entitled to a decree for specifie per formance of the agreement.
