The appellant took an electric motor from an electrical Works in which the respondent was employed.
Dispute arose about the terms on which the motor had been taken.
The appellant wrote a letter to the Works that he had purchased the motor after paying its full price; on behalf of the works it was said that it had only been given on hire.
The Works, through the respondent, filed a complaint against the appellant alleging breach of trust.
The complaint was dismissed by the trying magistrate but in appeal under section 417(3) Criminal Procedure Code the High Court held that the claim of ownership made by the appellant in his letter was not bona fide and that by writing the said letter he had sought to cause wrongful gain to himself and wrongful loss to the works in violation of the entrustment, which made him guilty under section 406 of the Indian Penal Code.
In appeal to the Supreme Court by special leave, HELD:The appeal must succeed.
Clearly section 405 contemplates something being done with respect to the property which would indicate either misappropriation or conversion to the offender 's own use, or its use or disposal in violation of the contract express or implied.
But when as in the present case nothing was done with respect to the use of the property which was not in accordance with the hiring agreement between the parties it cannot be said there was misappropriation or conversion of the property or its use or disposal in violation of the contract.
The appellant did not part with the possession of the motor to any body else; he put it to his own use the purpose for which he had taken it.
The use of the motor remained the same after the letter in question as before it.
The said letter merely raised a dispute of a civil nature between the parties and there was no question of any criminal breach of trust punishable under section 406 with respect to the matter on the basis of that letter.
