A Criminal case was instituted in the court of a Magistrate at Calcutta against the appellant under section 332 of the Indian Penal Code for voluntarily causing hurt to the Bailiff of Calcutta Corporation and another.
After hearing both sides the Magistrate was of the opinion that the charge under section 332 could not be sustained but as there was evidence to establish a Prima facie case under section 323 of the Indian Penal Code, he charged the appellant under that section.
The appellant pleaded not guilty and (1) ; 32 246 claimed to be tried and submitted that in view of the provisions Of section 251A(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, he should have been acquitted and the trial for the offence under section 323 Indian Penal Code, could not be proceeded with.
The Magistrate rejected the contention and convicted the appellant.
On the question whether a magistrate after making an order of discharge under section 251A(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code in respect of a charge of an offence triable as a warrant case can still proceed to try the accused for another offence, which would be made out from the police report: Held, that an order of discharge made by the Magistrate in exercise of the powers under sub section
(2) Of section 251A, does not mean the discharge of the accused in respect of all the offences, which the facts mentioned in the police report would make out.
The order of discharge being only in respect of the offences triable under Chapter XXI does not affect in any way the position that charges of offences triable under Chapter XX also are contained in the police report.
In the instant case even after the order of discharge was made in respect of the offence under section 332 Of the Indian Penal Code, the minor offence under section 323 of which the Magistrate bad also taken cognizance remained for trial as there was no indication to the contrary.
That being an offence triable under Chapter XX of the Code of Criminal procedure the Magistrate rightly followed the procedure under Chapter XX.
When a Magistrate takes cognizance under section 190(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code, he takes cognizance of all offences, constituted by the facts reported by the Police Officer and not of some only out of those offences.
