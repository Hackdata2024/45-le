In response to a notice from the assessing authority under the Punjab General Sales Tax Act that the appellant had not filed a return in respect of the assessment year 1959 60, the appellant claimed that the firm had ceased to do any work since February.
1961 and that a formal document to that effect was executed in August, 1961.
The assessing authority made an order of assessment in March 1962.
In a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution filed ' by the appellant; the High Court directed the Sales Tax Officer to enquire and report if the appellant firm had proved its dissolution in August 1961 or before the date of assessment order.
The Sales Tax Officer reported that it had not, The High Court itself examined the matter and came to the s.me conclusion of that reached by the Sales Tax Officer.
It also found that though intimation was required to be given under section 16 of the Act regarding the dissolution of the firm within 30 days of such dissolution no such intimation was given under April, 1962 and dismissed the writ petition.
Dismissing the appeal to this Court, HELD: (1) There is no sufficient ground to interfere with the judgment of the High Court.
The facts and circum stances referred to by the High Court throw a considerable doubt upon the correctness of the appellant 's statement that it had stood dissolved in August, 1961.
[754 D & B] (2) The High Court was dealing with the matter on the writ side.
In a writ petition, the scope for interference.
with a finding of the departmental authorities is much more restricted and the court can normally interfere only if the finding is based upon extraneous or irrelevant evidence or is otherwise perverse.
The same cannot be said of the finding of the sales tax authority embodied in its report sent to the High Court in the present case.
