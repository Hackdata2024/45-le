On a civil miscellaneous petition for clarification of this Court 's judgment dated 4th November, 1988, the Court.
HELD: The assessable value of the processed fabric would be the value of the grey cloth in the hands of the processor plus the value of the job work done plus manufacturing profit and manufacturing expenses whatever these may be, which will either be included in the price at the factory gate or deemed to be the price at the factory gate for the processed fabric.
[345D E] The factory gate means the "deemed" factory gate as if the processed fabric was sold by the processor.
[345E] If the trader.
who entrusts cotton or man made fabric to the processor for processing on job work basis, would give a declaration to the processor as to what would be the price at which he would be selling the processed goods in the market, that would be taken by the Excise authorities as the assessable value of the processed fabric and excise duty would be charged to the processor on that basis.
Such a declaration would include only the price or deemed price at which the processed fabric would leave the processor 's factory plus his profit.
It is necessary to include the processor 's expenses, costs and charges plus profit, but not the trader 's profits who gets the fabrics processed, because those would be post manufacturing profits.
