The respondent while he was posted as a Squadron Leader at Delhi was on June 27, 1968 allotted by the Directorate of Estate a residential fiat in the Curzon Road Hostel on a monthly rent of Rs. 161, under sub r.(1) of SR 317 .B 11.
Although he was transferred from Delhi to Chandigarh on June 11, 1970, he did not give any intimation of his transfer to the Directorate of Estates and therefore the said allotment stood automatically cancelled under sub r.
(2) thereof after the concessional period of two months from the date of his transfer i.e. w.e.f. August 11, 1970.
The respondent contin ued in unauthorised occupation of the said fiat for a period of nearly five years and in the meanwhile he was being charged the normal rent for that period.
On February 28, 1975 the Estate Officer having come to know of the transfer of the respondent from Delhi, the Directorate addressed a letter dated March 18, 1975 cancelling the allotment w.e.f.
August 11, 1970.
On the next day i.e. the 19th, the Direc torate sent another letter asking the respondent to vacate the fiat, which he did on March 25, 1975.
The Estate Officer raised a demand for recovery of Rs.38,811.
17 p. under SR 3 17 B 22 and served the respondent with a notice under s.7(3) of the .
The 95 respondent disputed his liability to pay damages for the period of his unauthorised occupation.
Thereupon, the Estate Officer initiated proceedings under s.7 of the Act to recov er the amount of Rs.38,811. 17p.
Subsequentiy, the Central Government on a representation being made by the respondent reduced the amount to Rs.20,482.78p.
On compassionate grounds and deducted the same on October 30, 1976 from out of the commuted pension payable to him.
The respondent filed a petition under Art.226 of the Constitution before the High Court.
The writ petition was allowed by a learned Single Judge holding that although the allotment of the flat stood cancelled in terms of sub r.(3) of SR 317 B 11 w.e.f. August 11, 1970 i.e. after the conces sional period of two months from the date of his transfer, the government was estopped from claiming the amount of Rs.20,482.78p.
as damages equivalent to the market rent under SR 317 B 22 for the period from August 11, 1970 to March 25, 1975 on the ground that the government not only knowingly allowed the respondent to continue in occupation till March 25, 1975 but also charged him the normal rent of Rs. 161 p.m. presumably under its power of relaxation under SR 317 B 25.
Further, he held that the government having failed to serve the respondent with a notice that he would be liable to pay market rent for the period of his unautho rised occupation, the doctrine of promissory estoppel pre cluded the government from claiming damages equivalent to the market rent under SR 317 B 22 for the period in ques tion.
On appeal, a Division Bench upheld the decision of the learned Single Judge mainly on the terms of SR 317 B 23 which conferred the power of relaxation on the government.
Hence the appeal by Special Leave.
Allowing the appeal, in part, the Court, HELD: 1.1 The Government could not unilaterally deduct the amount of Rs.20,482.78p.
from the commuted pension payable to the respondent, contrary to s.11 of the Pension Act, 1871.
[106B C] 1.2 According to its plain terms, section 11 of the protects from attachment seizure or sequestration pension or money due or to become due on account of any such pension.
The words "money due or to become due on account of pension" by necessary implication mean money that has not yet been paid on account of pension or has not been received by the pensioner and therefore wide enough to include commuted pension.

2.1 The construction placed by the High Court on the two provisions contained in SR 317 B 22 and SR 3 17 B 25 is apparently erroneous.
It is plain upon the terms of SR 3 17 B 22 that the liability to pay damages equal to the market rent beyond the concessional period is an absolute liability and not a contingent one.
The Court was clearly in error in subjecting the liability of a government officer to pay market rent for period of unauthorised occupation to the fulfilment of the condition that the Director of Estate should serve him with a notice that in the event of his continuing in unauthorised occupation he would be liable to pay market rent.
[101A C] 2.2 Non recovery of the rent at the market rent as permissible under SR 317 B 22 due to inaction of the govern ment and allowing the allottee to continue in authorised occupation for a period of nearly five years, as in this case, does not lead to the presumption that the government had relaxed the condition in his favour under SR 317 B 25.
[101D] 2.3 For a valid exercise of power of relaxation, the condition pre requisite under SR 3 17 B 25 is that the government may relax all or any of the provisions of the Rules in the case of an officer or residence or class of officers or types of residences, for reasons to be recorded in writing.
There was no question of any presumption arising for the relaxation which had to be by a specific order by the government for reasons to be recorded in writing.
[101D E] 3.
There was no question of any promissory estoppel operating against the government in a matter of this kind.
Before an estoppel can arise, there must be first a repre sentation of an existing fact distinct from a mere promise made by one party to the other; secondly that the other party believing it must have been induced to act on the faith of it; and thirdly, that he must have so acted to his detriment.
In this case, there was no representation or conduct amounting to representation on the part of the government intended to induce the respondent to believe that he was permitted to occupy the fiat in question on payment of normal rent or that he was induced to change his position on the faith of it.
