Appellant was a tenant under the respondents.
Action for eviction against the appellant was initiated on the pleas that there was "wilful default" in the matter of payment of rent and that the lease was residential but it had been used partly for commercial activity.
At the time of filing of the petition for eviction three months ' rent had fallen due.
The appellant 's case was that rent was not being collected every month and every two to three months the respondents landlords used to come and collect rent at their convenience, and that mixed use of the premises was the basis of the tenancy.
The original authority dismissed the petition.
In appeal it was reversed.
The High Court upheld the reversal holding that there was no case of wilful default and that the prem ises had been rented out also for business use.
In the appeal by special leave the tenant appellant contended that there was no case of wilful default and that the premises had been rented out also for business use and the change of user was since 1973.
Allowing the appeal of the tenant, this court, HELD: 1.
In the several statutes operating in the different states regulating the law relating to landlord and tenant 'wilful ' default has been made the ground of eviction while default is not.
[205 E] 204 2.
A situation where the landlord had consented to collect rent for two to three months a time, non payment of rent for three months cannot constitute wilful default.
[205 F] 3.
It is not disputed that from 1973 there had been change of use.
The petition for eviction was of 1980.
It follows that for seven years no objection was raised for change of use and for the first time when eviction was sought, conversion was made the second ground.
In these circumstances the landlords accepted the user to be also other than residential.
