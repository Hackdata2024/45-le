The first appellant filed a suit on a promissory note.
Prior to the institution of the suit, the executant of the promissory note had filed a complaint against the appellants alleging that they had forcibly taken his thumb impressions on a number of blank forms of promissory notes.
The Magistrate 'acquitted the, appellants.
Thereafter.
the suit on the promissory note was dismissed on the ground that the promissory note was a forgery because, the stamps affixed were of a date later than that of the promissory note.
The Court then filed a complaint against the appellants for the offence of forgery.
The appellants were convicted for forgery and abetment of forgery.
In appeal to this Court, HELD: In the earlier criminal case, the allegation that the executant 's thumb impressions on blank forms were obtained by force, was found to be false.
That finding was final and could not be reopened because of the rule as to issue estoppel.
Therefore, the sub stratum of the present case failed and the appellants could not be convicted for the offence of forgery and its abetment.
[532 D F] The rule of issue estoppel is not covered by section 403, Criminal Procedure Code, which deals with the principle of autrefois acquit: but that section does not preclude the applicability of the rule.
The rule is in accordance with sound principle and was applied in two decisions of this Court, namely, Pritam Singh vs State of Punjab, A.I.R. 1956 S.C. 415 and Manipur Administration vs Thockechom Bira Singh, ; There is no reason for casting any doubt on its soundness or for taking a different view.
