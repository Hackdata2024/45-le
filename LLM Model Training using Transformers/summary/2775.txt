The Rohtak Municipal Committee was superseded in August 1954, and an Administrator was appointed under section 238 of the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911.
In June 1958 the provisions of the Punjab Town Improvement Act, 1922, were extended to the Municipality and the Rohtak Improvement Trust was set up under the Act.
In August 1961, the Government issued a notification under section 103 (1) of the 1922 Act dissolving the Trust.
The Municipal Committee was reconstituted in January 1962 and in October 1962 the Government decided to reconstitute the Trust.
The Municipal Committee thereupon passed a resolution opposing the reconstitution of the Trust.
In January 1963, however, the Government re constituted the Trust and the Municipal Committee was asked to name its representatives to be appointed as trustees.
The rate payers filed a writ petition challenging the reconstitution of the trust and the High Court allowed the petition.
In appeal to this Court, HELD : (1) The attention of the High Court was not drawn to section 4A of the 1922 Act and therefore it erred in holding that the Trust could not be set up in 1958 because, under section 1(3) of the 1922 Act a Trust cannot be created in a Municipal area unless the committee was functioning.
Under section 4A, where the Municipal Committee was superseded the State ,Government could appoint the trustees, and there was no anomaly in the Government nominating the trustees, because, the Administrator who had all the powers and duties of the Committee under section 238 of the 1911 Act was competent to say to the Government that the 1922 Act should not be applied to the Municipality.
[205 C D 206 B] (2) Once the 1922 Act had come into operation under section 1(3), it ,continues to apply and it was not necessary to apply it again when the Municipal Committee was reconstituted in 1962.
[206 D] (3) Under sections 3 and 4 of the 1922 Act and the General Clauses (Punjab) Act, 1898, Government has the power to create a new trust or reconstitute a Trust which was dissolved.
