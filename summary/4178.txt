Dismissing the appeals, by special leave the Court, ^ HELD: Section 153A(1) is not confined to the promotion of feelings of enmity etc.
on grounds of religion only, but takes in promotion of such feelings on other grounds as well such as race, place of birth, residence, language, caste or community.
[1083G] In the instance case: Both the articles do promote feelings of enmity, hatred and ill will between the Hindu and Muslim communities.
[1086C] (i)|The first article "A tale of two Communalisms" is not even thinly veiled as a political thesis; it is an undisguised attempt to promote feelings of enmity, hatred and ill will between the Hindu and the Muslim communities.
It is designed to fan the sparks of ill will and hatred on ground of community.
The reference to the alleged Muslim tradition of rape, loot, violence and murder and the alleged terror struck into the hearts of Hindu minority in a neighbouring country by periodical killings, in the context of his thesis that communalism is the instrument of a militant minority can lead to no other inference.
[1084E F] (ii)|The second article 'Lingering disgrace of history ' goes further and is calculated to rouse feelings of enmity, hatred and ill will between Muslims and Hindus.
It was wrong to present the Moghuls as the ancestors of today 's Muslims and to willify the Muslims as the proud discendants of the "foul" Moghuls.
[1084G, 1086A, B, C] Feelings of enmity, hatred or ill will between different religious groups or communities cannot be promoted in the guise of political thesis of historical truth.
[1086C]
