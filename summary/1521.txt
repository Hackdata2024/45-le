Although an accused person is not entitled to lead evidence in his defence in a proceeding under section 207A of the Code of criminal Procedure, that does not affect the wide powers a Criminal Court has under section 540 of the Code to summon and examine persons as court witnesses where it considers such examination essential for a just decision of the case.
Section 540 of the Code is wide enough to include a proceeding under section 207A of the Code and its operation is not excluded by the scheme of section 207A of the Code.

695 referred to.
Sub section (6) of section 207A of, the Code does not make it incumbent on the Magistrate to examine an accused person unless he thinks it necessary to do so.
Consequently, in the present case, where the Magistrate in a proceeding under section 207A of the Code rejected the applica tion of the accused persons for examination of witnesses in defence not because he had no power under section 540 of the Code to do so but on the ground that the application was vexatious and was intended to delay the proceeding and the High Court in revision on an erroneous view of the Magistrate 's order set it aside and directed examination of the accused person under s.342 of the Code.
Held, that the order of the High Court must be set aside.
