There was dispute about the property in suit between theappellants and the respondents.
The property was attached by the Magistrate under section 145 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
Subsequently the appellants filed a suit for declaration of their title to the property but made no prayer for the cansequential relief of possession.
The suit was decreed by the trial court but the High Court set aside the decree on the ground that the suit was bad under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act for failure to sue for possession.
Appeal to this Court was filed with certificate of fitness.
HELD: In a suit for declaration of title to property, filed when it stands attached under section 145 of the Criminal Procedure Code, it is not necessary to ask for the further relief of delivery of possession.
The fact, if it be so, that in the case of such an attachment the Magistrate holds possession on behalf of the party whom he ultimately finds to have been in possession, is irrelevant.
[656H 657B] Moreover the further relief contemplated by the proviso to section 42 of the Specific Relief Act is relief against the defendant only.
In the present case the Magistrate was in possession and he was not a party to the suit.
[657C D] Further it is not necessary to ask for possession when the property is in custodia legis.
There is no doubt that property under attachment under section 145 of the Code is in custodia legis.
