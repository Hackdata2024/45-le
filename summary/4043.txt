The appellant was charged with an offence under Section 302 I.P.C. After the recording of evidence was concluded, it was pointed out that the Sessions Judge had no jurisdiction to try the appellant as the appellant happened to fall under the provisions of the Haryana Children Act, 1974.
On remand, the Magistrate found the appellant was a child and proceeded to try him under the Haryana Act.
In a revision petition filed by the brother of the deceased, the High Court held that the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code 1973 prevailed over the provisions of the Haryana Act.
Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: The High Court was in error in holding that the Code of 1973 over ruled the Haryana Act and that the appellant should have been tried under the Code 1973.
The view taken by the Sessions Judge on this point was correct and the case of the appellant should have been referred to the Magistrate concerned for trial in accordance with the provisions of the Haryana Act.
[154G H] Section 5 carves out a clear exception to the provisions of the trial of an offence under any special or local law for the time being in force or any special jurisdiction or power conferred or any special form of procedure prescribed by any other law for the time being in force.
The Haryana Act was in force when the Code of 1973 was passed and therefore the Haryana Act far from being inconsistent with section 5 of the Code of 1973 appears to be fully protected by the provisions of section 5 of the Code of 1973.
