On the questions (1) whether an order imposing a levy on Khandsari could have retrospective operation so as to apply to sugar manufactured prior to the date of the order and (2) whether in fixing the price of levy sugar the Government should consider that the price fixed should be sufficient to cover the manufacturing cost.
^ HELD: 1.
It is not the question of retrospectivity of a statute but its actual working that is relevant.
It is settled law that where a statute operates in future it cannot be said to be retrospective merely because within the sweep of its operation all existing rights are included.
Once the notification for imposing the levy was made it will naturally apply to the existing stocks of khandsari with the petitioners irrespective of whether it was manufactured before or after the order.

The policy of price control has for its dominant object equitable distribution and availability of the commodity at fair price to benefit the consumers.
Individual interest, however precious, must yield to the larger interest of the community namely the consumers.
Even if the petitioners have to bear some loss there could be no question of the restrictions imposed on them being unreasonable.
[32 B] The fixation of price would be in the interest of consumers rather than that of the producers.
Moreover since the petitioners were allowed to sell freely at any rate they liked, the remaining 50% of sugar after excluding the 50% which they had to give to levey as also the produce by the second and third processes, the loss, if any, caused to the petitioners, would be minimal.
