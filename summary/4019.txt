The assessee appellant is a registered firm carrying on business at several places in the State of Kerala.
Apart from its regular trade in various commondities, the assessee was also carrying on a business in speculation.
In respect of the losses during the assessment years 1964 65, 1965 66 and the profit during the assessment year 1966 67, the Income Tax Officer apportioned the aforesaid losses and profits amongst the partners and rejected the assessee 's contention that the losses in speculation business should be carried forward and set off against the profit in the said business made in the assessment year 1966 67.
But the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, following the decision of this Court in C.I.T., Gujarat vs Kantilal Nathuchand Sami, accepted the assessee 's stand.
The Tribunal on second appeal answered in favour of the Revenue and the High Court also answered the reference against the assessee.
Dismissing the appeals by special leave the Court, ^ HELD :1.
The case of Kantilal Nathu Chand was decided on a true interpretation of Section 24(1) of the Income Tax Act 1922 and the two provisions appended thereto.
But the provisions of law contained in Chapter VI of the 1961 Act have made a considerable departure from the corresponding provisions of the 1922 Act.
[1274A, B D] It is clear from the provisions of Section 73 of the 1961 Act that the assessee 's loss in speculation business cannot be set off except against profits and gains, if any, of another speculation business.
[1275B] 2.
For the purpose of set off it is permissible to carry forward the losses to the following assessment year or years subject to the limit of eight years as provided in Section 73 of the 1961 Act.
[1275C] 3.
The provision contained in Sub section (2) of Section 73 of the 1961 Act is "subject to the other provisions of this Chapter", which includes section 75.
Under section 75 where the assesee is a registered firm, for the purpose of set off and carry forward of the loss apportionment between the partners of the firm has got to be made and they alone are entitled to have the amount of the loss set off and carried forward for set off.
The matter is put beyond any 1272 pale of doubt and challenge in sub section (2) of section 75 when it says that nothing contained in sub section (2) of section 73 shall entitle any assessee, being a registered firm to have its loss carried forward and set off under the provisions of Section 73(2).
