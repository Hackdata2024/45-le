The appellant was the sole proprietor of a business styled section N. Dutt SE Co. He gave a notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure to the respondent in the name of "section N. Dutt & Co.".
After the requisite period he filed a suit against the respondent describing the plaintiff as: "Surendra Nath Dutt sole proprietor of a business carried on under the name and style of section N. Datt & Co." The suit was dismissed on the ground that the notice was defective as it was issued by section N. Dutt & Co. and not the plaintiff.
The appellant contended that the notice was valid as section N. Dtitt carried on business and that no suit could have been filed in the name of section N. Dutt & Co. as it was not a firm.
Held, that the notice was defective and that the suit had been rightly dismissed.
The person who issued the notice was not the same as the person who filed the suit.
Since section N. Dutt & Co. could not file the suit in that name it could not give a valid and legal notice in that name.
A valid notice could have been given only in the name of section N. Dutt.
A defect in the notice as to the name of the plaintiff has to be viewed strictly.
