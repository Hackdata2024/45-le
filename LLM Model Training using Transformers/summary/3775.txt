The appellant was a mechanic in the service of the erstwhile Transport Department of the Kerala State.
He thereafter became.
an employee of the Kerala State Transport Corporation when the same was set up in March, 1965.
In 1968, there was a settlement between the Corporation and its employees providing that a `trade test ' would have to be passed for promotion to.
posts in the higher grade while "grade promotions" would take place upto the post of Assist ant Chargeman.
Subsequently, in a dispute referred to arbitration, the Award provided that category wise seniori ty, together with trade test should determine the promo tions.
The petitioner alleged that thereafter, the Corpora tion and the workmen agreed to promotions in his wing by seniority alone and consequently, the petitioner and some others were promoted.
Their promotions were assailed as violative of the award, and were set aside by the High Court.
The petitioner filed a writ petition under article 32 of the Constitution claiming that his fundamental right under article 16(1) had been violated.
Dismissing the writ petition the Court, HELD: The rights of the petitioner under an agreement or an award, if he had any such right, could not be identified with rights under Article 16(1) of the Constitution.
The result of the quashing of the promotion order relating to a whole category of employees in the position of the petition er was that all similarly situated shared the same fate and all.
those in the petitioner 's category and with his quali fications had been placed on an equal looting.
The peti tioner 's remedy when he claims a benefit under an agreement or an award does not lie by means of a petition under article 32 of the Constitution.
