The assessee, a public limited company, in the assess ment year 1964 65 was in the second year of its new project going into production.
The Income tax Officer computed the assessment under section 143(3) of the Income tax Act, 1961 after determining the rebate admissible under sections 84 and 101 at Rs.2,72,372.
He re opened the assessment under section 147(b) and re computed the rebate at Rs.2,51,222.
The appeal by the assessee to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was dis missed.
The Appellate Tribunal accepted the plea of the assessee that to the figure of capital as worked out under Rule 19(1) is to be added the average profit as worked out under sub rule (5) of Rule 19 and held that the average capital has to be taken at Rs.45,39,557 and not at Rs.41,87,034.
In the Reference, the High Court agreed with the conclusion reached by the Appellate Tribunal.
Dismissing the Appeal of the Revenue, HELD: 1.
Admissibility of exemption under section 84 of the Incometax Act, 1961 which has been repealed with effect from 1.4.1968 has never been in dispute.
What has been deputed is the manner of its computation.
Rule 19 of the Income tax Rules, 1962 prescribes the method of computation and on a proper interpretation of sub rule (1), (3) and (5) of this Rule would depend the ultimate conclusion to be reached.
[590F G] 2.
The High Court is right in saying that the dispute has to be resolved by referring to sub rules (1), (3), (5) and (6) of Rule 19.
The High Court found that the value of assets entitled to depreciation under Rule 19(1)(a) worked out to Rs.40,10,947.
To this figure was added a sum of Rs.1,39,764 on account of depreciation as on 1.1.63 as also on account of the average value of additions.
The other assets were valued under Rule 19(1)(b) at Rs.44,38,126 as on 1.1.63.
All put together the 589 aggregate valuation came to Rs.85,38,837.
From this aggre gate, deduction of sum of Rs.44,01,803 representing loans, other liabilities including provision for tax as authorised by Rule 19 was made leaving the valuation of the capital at Rs.41,87,034.
To this figure the sum of Rs.3,52,503 being half of the profit from the New Project was added to compute the value at Rs.45,39,537.
Following the provision of section 84, entitlement to exemption was determined at Rs.2,72,372 representing 6% of the capital employed in the new industri al undertaking.
[592C E] 3.
Re assessment was made by deleting the addition of Rs.3,52,503 ' which represented half the profit of the year.
According to the Revenue, profits earned during the year had already been taken into account in the process of computa tion and there was no warrent for its addition over again to the extent of a moiety.
In fact, that is the only dispute that fell to be resolved.
The High Court took note of the fact that profits had necessarily been reflected in the average valuation of the assets but in its view the deeming provision of Rule 19(5) was the special procedure laid down for computation for the purpose of calculation and could not be over looked for the reasons advanced by the Revenue.
There is sufficient force in the reasoning of the High Court and the conclusion reached by it is accepted.
