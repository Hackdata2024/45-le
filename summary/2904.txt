The appellant State issued an Order according to which reservation of posts for Scheduled castes.
tribes and backward classes was made applicable not only to initial recruitment but also to promotions.
Respondents 1 and 3 were in the 'State Government service and the former was the senior.
But since the latter belonged to a scheduled caste he was promoted over.
the first respondent as per the Order.
The High Court quashed the promotion on the basis that such reservation might lead to various anomalies.
In appeal to this Court, HELD : Article 16(1) provides for equality of opportunity to all citizens in relation to appointment to any office in the service of the State subject to the exception in article 16(4) that the State may make reservations in favour of backward classes.
The reservation contemplated by article 16(4) can be made not merely to initial recruitment but also to Posts to which promotions are to be made.
Every such reservation under article 16(4) does introduce an element of discrimination and promotion of junior officers over seniors; but the Constitution makers thought fit, in the interests of society as a whole, that backward classes should be afforded some protection.
If, however, the reservation under article 16(4) makes the rule in article 16(1) meaningless the decision of the State would be open to judicial review; but the burden of establishing that a particular reservation is offensive to article 16(1) is on the person who takes the plea.
[271 C, E, 272 D G, 273 D F] In the present case, there was no material from which it could be concluded that the impugned Order violated article 16(1).
The reservation could not be struck down on hypothetical grounds or on imaginary possibilities.
