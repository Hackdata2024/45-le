The petitioner, a driver, of a heavy automobile, was sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment under section 304A IPC for having killed a scooterist by his rash and negligent driving of the vehicle.
The petitioners plea that someone else was responsible for the accident was rejected by the trial and appellate courts.
on the question whether the sentence was excessive, ^ HELD: Rashness and negligence are relative concepts, not absolute abstractions.
The law under section 304A IPC and under the rubric of negligence, must have regard to the fatal frequency of rash driving of heavy duty vehicles and of speeding menaces.
It is fair, therefore, to apply the role of res ipsa loquitur with care.
When a life has been lost And the circumstances of driving are harsh, no compassion can be shown.
[848 A B, D] The petitioner deserves no consideration on the question of conviction and sentence.
[848 C] [(a) Sentencing must have a policy of correction.
When the punishment is for driving offences, the State should attach a course for better driving together with a livelier sense of responsibility and in the case of men with poor families, the State may consider occasional parole and reformatory course.
[848 E F] (b) Victim reparation is still the vanishing point of criminal law.
The victims of the crime, and the distress of dependents of the prisoner, do not attract the attention of the law.
This deficiency in the system must be rectified by the Legislature [848 G]
