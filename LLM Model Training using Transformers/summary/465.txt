V died an infant in 1927 and H, an agnatic relation.
filed a, suit for the recovery of the properties belonging to V which were in the possession of third parties, on the ground that he was the sole nearest male agnate entitled to all the properties.
During the pendency of the suit a Receiver was appointed for the properties in February, 1928.
The suit having been decreed H obtained possession of the properties from the Receiver on January 20, 1930, and after his death in 1936, his nephew, the appellant, got into possession as His heir.
On October 23, 1941, the respondent brought the present suit for the recovery of a one third share of the properties from the appellant on the footing that he and his brother were agnatic relations of V of the same degree as H, that all the three were equal co heirs of V and that H obtained the decree and got into possession on behalf of all the co heirs.
The appellant resisted the suit and contended that the respondent lost his right by the adverse possession of H and his successor and that for this purpose not only the period from January 20, 1930, to October 23, 1941, was to be counted, but also the prior period when the Receiver was in possession of the properties during the pendency of H 's suit.
it was found that the; respondent 's case that H obtained the decree and got possession, from the Receiver on behalf of the other co heirs was not true : Held, that the respondent did not lose his right by adverse possession.
Even assuming that H 's possession from January 20, 1930, was adverse and amounted to ouster of the other co heirs, such adverse possession was not adequate in time to displace the title of the respondent and the period during which the Receiver was in possession could not be added, because (1) the Receiver 's 196 possession could not be tacked on to H 's possession, as a Receiver is an officer of the Court and is not the agent of any party to the suit and notwithstanding that in law his possession is ultimately treated as possession of the successful party on the termination of the suit, he could not be considered as the agent of such party with ' the animus of claiming sole and exclusive title with the view to initiate adverse possession ; and (2) during the time of the Receiver 's possession the respondent could not sue H, and limitation could not therefore run against him.
The possession of one co heir is considered, in law, as possession of all the co heirs and in order to establish adverse possession ouster of the non possessing co heir should be made out and as between them there must be evidence of open assertion of hostile title, coupled with exclusive possession and enjoyment by one of them to the knowledge of the other so as to constitute ouster.
