The petitioner was an allottee of the premises held by the Government at the relevant time.
The landlady applied for release of the premises but the request was rejected.
However, upon a further representation made by the landlady stating that her son was not allowing her to live with him in another house belonging to her, the Government made an order releasing the premises in her favour and asked the petitioner to vacate the premises.
Several notices were also issued to him in that behalf.
The petitioner challenged the order of release contending that he had not been given an opportunity to show cause, and, that the Government had no power to review its earlier order rejecting the request; but the petition was dismissed by the High Court.
Dismissing the petition for Special Leave to appeal.
HELD: It is well settled law of this Court that in case of bona fide need, subsequent events must be taken into account if they are relevant to the question of release of possession of the premises.
The contention that the Govern ment cannot review its own order cannot be accepted.
When, in spite of the 'notices given to him, the petitioner did not choose to move out of the premises it cannot be said that he was not given an opportunity to show cause.
