The respondent, a displaced person from Pakistan was allotted 55 80 Standard Acres of land in lieu of the land left by him in Pakistan.
While determining the surplus area, the appellant State interpreting the phrase "as the case may be" in proviso (ii)(a) to Section 2(3) of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act, 1953, left with the respondent 100 ordinary acres equivalent to 29.81 Standard Acres and treated 25.99 standard acres equivalent to 78.57 ordinary acres as surplus.
The respondent preferred an appeal contending that the surplus should be 5.80 standard acres on a true interpretation of the proviso, which failed.
The revision before the Financial Commissioner met with the same fate.
The contention of the respondent was upheld by the High Court while allowing the Writ Petition filed by him.
The Letters Patent Appeal filed by the State was dismissed.
On an appeal by special leave, the Court, while dismissing it, ^ HELD: (i) The contention that the words "as the case may be" in proviso (ii)(a) to section 2(3), gives a discretion to the authorities to determine the permissible area either in standard or in ordinary acres is not correct.
[212 B C] (ii) On a plain reading, proviso (ii)(a) indicates that where the land allotted to a displaced person was in standard acres and its area exceeded 50 standard acres, the permissible area would be 50 standard acres, and where the land was allotted not in standard acres, the permissible area would be 100 ordinary acres.
The nature of the original allotment whether it was in standard acres or in ordinary acres is the determinating factor.
[212 C D] (iii) The meaning given to proviso (ii)(a) by the Full Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High Court, in Khan Chand vs State of Punjab A.I.R. 1966 Punjab 423, is correct It is only construed this way that the words "as the case may be" acquire a significance, otherwise they would be mere surplusage.
[212 D E] Khan Chand vs State of Punjab, A.I.R. 1966 Punjab 423, approved.
