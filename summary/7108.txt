The Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court took a contrary view and held that it was taxable as an unclassified commodity at 3.5%.
Before this court it was contended that phosphorous bronze is made of tin and copper only; that a small quantity of phosphorous is used to deoxidize the metal and that it is not an essential substance of the phosphorous bronze.
It was, however, admitted that without the use of phosphorous, phosphorous bronze cannot he produced, and a certain quantity remains in the phosphorous bronze.
Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: (1) The emphasis in the entry is that it must contain, even if an alloy, "only" copper, tin, nickel or zinc.
The expression "only" is very material for understanding the meaning of the entry.
Since the alloy in dispute contains phosphorous, may he in a very small quantity, it cannot fall within entry 2(a) of the notification.
