The appellant, a registered dealer under the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957, was purchasing iron scraps from dealers inside and outside the State of Karnataka for the purpose of manufacturing iron ingots, steel rounds and for steel.
He filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the Constitutional validity of Section 5(4) of the Act in so far as it pertains to item 2 of Schedule IV to the Act read with Explanation II thereof in respect of its application prior to 1.4.78 as violative of Article 304(a) of the Constitution on the ground that it discriminates in respect of sale of steel ingots manufactured out of raw material purchased from outside the State which was subject to tax while sale of similar goods manufactured out of locally purchased raw material was not subjected to tax.
The High Court dismissed the writ petition upholding the constitutional validity of the impugned provisions.
Hence this appeal by special leave.
Setting aside the judgment of the High Court and allow ing the appeal, this Court, 253 HELD: 1.
The similarity contemplated by Article 304(a) is in the nature of the quality and kind of the goods and not with respect to whether they were subject to a tax already or not.
[262A] 2.
