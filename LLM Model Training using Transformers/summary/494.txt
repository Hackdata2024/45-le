The petitioners entertained grave doubts as to the propriety of holding the Presidential election before the general elections had been completed throughout the entire territory of India and, by applications filed under article 71(1) of the Constitution as citizens of India, invoked the jurisdiction and power of the Supreme Court thereunder to inquire into such doubts and sought for an order restraining the Election Commission from taking the poll in connection with the election of the President, fixed for May 6, 1957, till the general elections in the Union territory of Himachal Pradesh and in two Lok Sabha Constituencies of the State of Punjab, which were still to be held, had been completed.
