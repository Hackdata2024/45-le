% The suit property known as "Gopal Lal Villa" situated on the outskirts of the city of Varanasi was a sprawling 60 years old building, part of the estate of a Raja, and vested in the appellant.
It was acquired pursuant to preliminary Notification dated 4.7.1959 under the Land Acquisition Act 1894 for the purposes of the Education Department of the Government of Uttar Pradesh.
The building was of about 25,000 square feet plinth area comprising 35 rooms, halls and other appurtenances, and the 23.66 acres of ground appurtenant to the building, had 431 fruit and 13 timber trees and 12 bamboo clumps.
The appellant claimed compensation of Rs.8,00,580 for the land valuing it at Rs.352 per decimal.
Rs.3,50,000 for the building and structures; Rs.41,010 for the tree growth and Rs.5,000 as compensation for change of residence.
The Land Acquisition Officer by his Award dated 4.11.1961 1026 under section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act determined the market value of the land at Rs.3,31,340 valuing it at Rs.140 per decimal; of the building and superstructure at Rs.57,660 and of the tree growth at Rs.355.83.
Being aggrieved with the aforesaid determination of compensation the appellant did not accept the offer contained in the Award, and sought for a reference under section 18 of the Act to the Civil Court.
The District Court enhanced the market value of the land to Rs.4,73,200 i.e. from Rs.140 to Rs.200 per decimal and left the valuation of the building and the tree growth undisturbed.
The High Court affirmed the Award of the District Court and dismissed the appellant 's claim for further enhancement.
In the appeal to this Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the claim of Rs.352 per decimal was not accepted and that the High Court in affirming the valuation of the land at a mere Rs.200 per decimal overlooked certain settled principles of valuation.
It adopted the District Judge 's valuation which was the average of the valuation reflected in Ext.
2 and Ext.
19 while the higher of the two figures indicated by Ext.
2 should have been adopted.
It was further contended that the appellant was entitled to solatium and interest at higher rates in view of the re introduction of section 23(2) in 1972 by the U.P. Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1972 and under the Central Amendment Act 68 of 1984.
On behalf of the respondent it was contended that the changes in law brought about by the State Amendment Act No. 28 of 1972 and the Central Amending Act 68 of 1984 are presumptively prospective except to the extent that they are made expressly or by compelling implication retrospective in the extension of their benefits.
On the question whether: (1) ^ HELD: 1.(i) The determination of market value of a piece of land with potentialities for urban use is an intricate exercise which calls for collection and collation of diverse economic criteria.
[1033C D] (ii) The market value of a piece of property for purposes of section 23 of the Land Acquisition Act is stated to be the price at which the property changes hands from a willing seller to a willing, but not too anxious a buyer, dealing at arm 's length.
[1033D] (iii) Prices fetched for similar lands with similar advantages and potentialities under bonafide transactions of sale at or about the time of the preliminary notification are the usual, and indeed the best, evidences of market value.
Other methods of valuation are resorted to if the evidence of sale of similar lands is not available.
[1033E F] (iv) Prices fetched for smaller plots cannot form safe bases valuation of large tracts of land as the two are not comparable properties.

(v) However, if it is shown that the large extent to be valued does admit of and is ripe for use for building purposes; that building plots that could be laid out on the land would be good selling propositions and that valuation on the basis of the method of a hypothetical lay out 1028 could with justification be adopted, then in valuing such small, laid out sites the valuation indicated by sale of comparabe small sites in the area at or about the time of the notification would be relevant.
[1034G H] (vi) In a case such as the above, necessary deduction for the extent of land required for the formation of roads and other civic amenities; expenses of development of the sites by laying out roads, drains, sewers, water and electricity lines, and the interest on the outlays for the period of deferment of the realisation of the price; the profits on the venture etc.
are to be made.
[1034H; 1035A B] Sahib Singh Kalha & Ors.
vs Amritsar Improvement Trust and Ors., referred to.
(vii) Prices fetched for small plots cannot directly be applied in the case of large areas, for the reason that the former reflects the 'retail ' price of land and the latter the 'wholesale ' price.
[1035B] (viii) Subsequent transactions which are not proximate in point of time to the acquisition can be taken into account for purposes of determining whether as on the date of acquisition there was an upward trend in the prices of land in the area.
[1035C] (ix) Where it is shown that the market was stable and there were no fluctuations in the prices between the date of the preliminary notification and the date of such subsequent transaction, the transaction could also be relied upon to ascertain the market value.
(a) When there is evidence to the effect that there was no upward surge in the prices in the interregnum.
(b) The burden of establishing this would be squarely on the party relying on such subsequent transaction.
[1035C D,G] State of U.P. vs Major Jitender Kumar, referred to.
In the instant case, the appellant did not endeavour to show that between the date of preliminary notification i.e. 4.7.1959 and the date of Ext.
24 i.e. 18.8.
1960 there was no appreciation in the value of land in the area.
Therefore, Ext.
24 cannot be relied upon as affording evidence of the market value as on 4.7.1959.
[1035G H] (xi) The valuation of land made in the present case does not call for or justify any upward revision at all.
(a) There is no justification to interfere with the determination of the market value of the land approved by the High Court.
[1036C D] 1029 In the instant case Rs.200 per decimal for the large extent of the acquired land works out to 40% of the "retail" price even if Rs.500 is taken as the 'retail ' price.
That apart, in the case of land with potentialities for a more profitable use it is necessary to acknowledge, and make due allowance for, the possibility that the land might not be applied for the prospective use at all or not so applied within a reasonable time.
[1036H; 1037A B] Bombay Improvement vs Mervanji Manekji Mistry, AIR 1926 Bombay 420 referred to.
2.(i) Usually land and building thereon constitute one unit.
Land is one kind of property; land and building together constitute an altogether different kind of property.
The latter must be valued as one unit.
[1037C D] (ii) However, where, the property comprises extensive land and the structures standing do not show that full utilisation potential of the land is realised it might not be impermissible to value the property estimating separately the market value of the land with reference to the date of the preliminary notification and to add to it the value of the structures as at that time.
[1037D E] (iii) By the above method, building value is estimated on the basis of the prime cost or replacement cost less depreciation.
The rate of depreciation is, generally, arrived at by dividing the cost of construction (less the salvage valued at the end of the period of utility) by the number of years of utility of the building.
[1037E F] (iv) The factors that prolong the life and utility of the building, such as good maintenance, influence and bring down the rate of depreciation.
[1037F] In the instant case, the estimate of the proper market value of the building has not received the requisite attention both before the High Court and the District Court.
It is no doubt true that the Valuation Report, Ext.
I, was prepared on 20.7.
1960 one year after the date of the preliminary notification.
But the extent of the built area was about 25,000 sq.
There is no evidence to suggest that the rates mentioned and adopted in Ext.
I were not rates valid for a spread out period.
No case was made out that the building had lost its utility and that the only mode of valuation appropriate to the case was one of awarding merely the salvage value.
The building, according to the evidence was quite 1030 strong though about 60 years old at the time.
The appropriate thing to do would have been to set aside the award in so far as the valuation of the building is concerned and remit the matter for a fresh determination of its market value as on 14.7.1959.
However, in the interest of justice it would be proper to make some ready and rough estimate drawing such sustenance as the evidence on record could afford and impart a quietus to this vexed litigation.
Accordingly, the compensation for the buildings and structures is enhanced from Rs.57,660 to Rs.2,00,000.
[1038G H; 1039D G; 1040G] 3.
Where land is valued with reference to its potentiality for building purposes and on the basis of prices fetched by small sites in a hypothetical lay out the tree growth on the land cannot be valued independently on the basis of its horticultural value or with reference to the value of the yield.
This principle, however, does not come in the way of awarding the timber value or the salvage value of the tree growth after providng for the cost of cutting and removing.
[1040G H; 1041A] In the instant case, the evidence shows that there were 471 fruit bearing trees and plants, 13 timber trees and 12 bamboo clusters.
Though there is some evidence as to the value of the yield, there is no evidence about the timber value and fuel value of the trees.
The District Judge has awarded a sum of Rs.355.85 for the entire tree growth.
Having regard to the large number of trees and to the fact that some of them were timber trees, it would be appropriate to award a lump sum of Rs.7,500 under this head.
The compensation for tree growth is accordingly enhanced from Rs.355.85 to Rs.7,500.
[1041A C] 4.
By the U.P. Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1954, Section 23(2) had been deleted from the statute.
It was re introduced by the U.P. Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act 1972.
The preliminary notification for the acquisition was issued subsequent to the deletion.
Whether re introduction of sub section (2) would enure to the benefit of the person whose land is acquired on the ground that proceedings in appeal were pending on the date of introduction of that provision, and availability for further enhancement of the solatium and rates of interest under the Central Amendment Act 68 of 1984 are left open with consent of counsel to be agitated after final decision in Bhag Singh vs U. T. of Chandigarh, by a larger Bench of this Court.
[1041E F; 1042B] 5.
The point concerning compensation to be awarded for change of residence under clause 'fifthly ' in section 23(1) does not appear to have been raised and urged before the High Court.
No specific ground 1031 has also been taken in this behalf in the appeal before this Court.
The appellant should not, therefore, be permitted to re agitate this question over again in this Court.
