TE JURISDICTION: Writ Petition (Crl) No. 708 of 1984.
(Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India) And Special Leave Petition (Crl) Nos.
1949 50 of 1984 (From the Judgment and Order dated 13.3.84 and 16.3.84 of the Bombay High Court in Special Case Nos. 24/82 & 3/83) Murli Bhandare, Govinddas, Ms. Bina Gupta, H.R. Bhardwaj and PP.
Singh for the petitioner.
Ram Jethmalani, Ashok Desai and Ms. Rani Jethmalani for the respondents.
The Order of the Court was delivered by AMARENDRA NATH SEN, J. There is no merit in this Writ Petition.
The writ petition is accordingly dismissed.
In my view, the writ petition challenging the validity of the order and judgment passed by this Court as nullity or otherwise incorrect cannot be entertained.
I wish to make it clear that the dismissal of this writ petition will not prejudice the right of the petitioner, to approach the Court with an appropriate review petition or to file any other application which he may be entitled in law to file.
483 DESAI, J. I broadly agree with the conclusion recorded by my brother.
The learned Judge in deciding the S.L.P. (Crl) Nos.
1149 50/1984 has followed the decision of this Court.
The learned Judge was perfectly justified and indeed it was the duty of the learned Judge to follow the decision of this Court which is binding on him.
Special leave petitions are dismissed.
H.S.K. Petitions dismissed.
