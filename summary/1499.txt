The appellant company had its Head Office in Calcutta generated electricity for distribution at Jabalpur.
By cl. 10 of the power of attorney executed by it, it authorised its Resident Engineer at Jabalpur, "subject to the Standing Orders from, time to time, given by the Company to appoint, dismiss, suspend or terminate the services of any of the employees of the Company at jabalpur".
The respondent was charge sheeted and after enquiry discharged by the Resident Engineer.
He made an application to the Assistant Labour Commissioner who ordered his reinstatement without break in his service by without payment of back wages.
The State Industrial Court, on revision applications by both the parties held that the Resident Engineer was not empowered to hold the enquiry and to issue an order of discharge and refused to interfere.
Both the parties moved the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution.
The High Court took the view that the powers of dismissal and suspension under cl. 19 of the Standing Orders and the general right to discharge an employee under cl. 20 of the Standing Orders could not be, and latter powers had not actually been, delegated to the Resident Engineer and allowed the respondent 's application with back wages.
Held, that the delegation of power by the power of attorney was vailed in law and covered powers both under cl. 19 and cl. 20 of the Standing Orders.
There was nothing in law, or in the Articles of the Association of the Company that forbade such delegation and the.
company therefore, could, delegate the powers to meet the exigencies of its business .
The opening words of cl. 10 of the power of attorney did not mean that the delegate could not at all exercise the powers since under the Standing Orders the company alone 454 could do so.
Their effect is that in exercising these powers the delegate cannot do anything that the company could not do under the Standing orders.
