Respondent No. 1 filed a complaint under section 420 IPC against the appellants alleging that a loan taken by them from him had not been repaid.
While the complaint was pending before a Magistrate the parties entered into a compromise under which the appellants undertook to repay the loan before a stipulated date.
The Magistrate accordingly allowed the parties to compound the case.
When the appellants failed to repay the loan in accordance with the undertaking given before the Magistrate the respondent moved the High Court for taking action against the appellants for contempt of court.
On the view that the appellants had committed a willful disobedience of the undertaking the High Court held that they were guilty of civil contempt and sentenced them to one month 's simple imprisonment.
Allowing the appeal in part, ^ HELD: 1.
The appellants had committed willful disobedience of the court of the Magistrate by committing serious breach of the undertaking given to it on the basis of which alone they had been acquitted.
The High Court was, therefore, right in holding that the appellants were guilty of civil contempt under section 2(b) of the Contempt of Courts Act.
[638 A] 2.
Having regard to the circumstances of the case the present case falls within the first part of section 12(3) of the Act and a sentence of fine alone should have been awarded by the High Court.
By enacting the section the legislature intended that a sentence of fine alone should be imposed in normal circumstances.
Special power is, however, conferred on the court to pass a sentence of imprisonment if it thought that ends of justice so required.
Therefore, before a court passed a sentence of imprisonment it must give special reasons for passing such a sentence.
[638 G] In the present case there are no special reasons why the appellants should be sent to jail
