The following order of the Court was delivered O R D E R After hearing Shri S.K. Kapoor, learned counsel appearing for respondent No. 1 in Criminal Appeals Nos.
251 252 of 1986 at quite some length, we are not persuaded to take a view different from the one expressed by this Court in the recent judgment in Baldev Krishna Sahi vs Shipping Corporation of India Ltd. & Anr., [ 1987] 4 SCC 361 overruling the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in Amrit Lal Chum vs Devi Ranjan Jha, as to the scope and effect of sub section
(1) of section 630 of the .
The Court in Baldev Krishna Sahi 's case has placed a beneficent construction on the provisions contained in sub section
(1) of section 630 of the Act 785 and according to it the term 'officer or employee ' in sub section
(1) of section 630 must be interpreted to mean not only the present officers and employees of a company but also to include the past officers and employees of the Company.
It has also taken the view that the words 'any such property ' in cl.
(b) thereof qualify the words 'any property of a company ' appearing in cl.
As observed in Baldev Krishna Sahi 's case, section 630 of the Act plainly makes it an offence if an officer or employee of a company who was permitted to use the property of the company during his employment, wrongfully retains or occupies the same after the termination of his employment.
It is the wrongful withholding of such property, meaning the property of the company after termination of the employment, which is an offence under section 630(l)(b) of the Act.
The construction placed by this Court in Baldev Krishna Sahi 's case is the only construction possible.
There is therefore no warrant to give a restrictive meaning to the term 'officer or employee ' appearing in sub section
(1) of section 630 of the Act as meaning only the existing officers and employees and not those whose employment have been terminated.
The Court in Baldev Krishna Sahi 's case has expressly overruled the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in Amrit Lal Chum vs Devi Ranjan Jha, supra, against which these appeals have been filed and upheld the consistent view to the contrary taken by the High Court of Bombay in a series of cases.
[See Harkishin Lakhimal Gidwani vs Achyut Kashinath Wagh, and Govind T. Jagtiani vs Sirajuddin section Kazi, Accordingly, these appeals must succeed and are allowed with costs.
The judgment of the High Court allowing the applications under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 are set aside.
Shri S.K. Kapoor, learned counsel appearing for respondent No. 1 in Criminal Appeals Nos. 251 252 of 1986 and Shri Parijat Sinha, learned counsel for respondent No. 1 in Criminal Appeal No. 368 of 1986 pray for time to vacate the premises in their occupation.
