Section 18(1) of the Bombay Rents,. ,. .
Control Act 1947 provides; " If any landlord either himself or through any person acting or Purporting to act on his behalf. . receives any fine, premium or other like sum or deposit or any consideration, other than 159 the standard rent in respect of the grant, renewal or continuance of a lease of any premises such landlord or in the manner indicated by the section.
Held, that the words " renewal or continuance of a lease clearly suggest that there must be a renewal or continuance of a subsisting lease.
They would not cover an executory contract to grant a lease.
Giving the words " in respect of " their widest meaning, viz., relating to " or " with reference to " it is plain that this relationship must be predicated of the grant, renewal or continuance of a lease and unless a lease comes into existence simultaneously or near about the time that the money is received it cannot be said that the receipt was " in respect of " the grant of a lease.
The relationship of landlord and tenant does not come into existence till a lease comes into existence, in other words, there is no relationship of landlord and tenant until there is a demise of the property which is capable of being taken possession of.
The section does not make the intention punishable, it makes an act punishable which is related to the existence of a lease.
It does not make receipt of money on an executory contract punishable.
