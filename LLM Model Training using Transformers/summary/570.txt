One D executed, on May 22, 1950, a deed of gift in favour of the appellants, his wife and sons.
Upon the application of his creditors D was adjudged an insolvent on August 21, 1951 and his estate vested in the respondent.
On September 26, 1951, the respondent took out a notice of motion under section 55 of the Presidency towns Insolvency Act for a declaration that the deed of gift was void.
In reply the appellants pleaded that the transaction, though it purported to be a gift, was in reality a transfer for valuable consideration.
The respondent objected that the evidence which the appellants sought to lead in support of their plea was inadmissible under section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act : Held, that section 92 of the Evidence Act was not applicable to the proceedings and the appellants were entitled to lead evidence in support of the plea raised by them.
Section 92 is only applicable to cases as between parties to an instrument or their representatives in interest.
Where, however the dispute is between a stranger to an instrument and a party to it or his representative in interest, section 92 is inapplicable, and both the stranger and the party or his representative are at liberty to lead evidence of oral agreement notwithstanding the fact that such evidence if believed, may contradict, vary, add to or subtract from its terms.
In the present case, though the appellants were the representatives in interest of the insolvent, the respondent, when he made the petition under section 55 of the Presidency towns Insolvency Act, was not acting as a representative in interest of the insolvent, and, therefore, the proceedings were not between the parties to the instrument or their representatives in interest.
