Section 4(h) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, as amended by the Bihar Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1959, which empowers the Collector to annul anticipatory transfers of land designed to defeat the object of the Act, is protected by article 31A of the Constitution although it does not by itself provide for the acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights therein or for the extinguishment or modification of any such rights and its constitutional validity cannot be questioned under articles 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution since the Act of which it is an integral part, is itself directed to that end and is protected by that Article.
Thakur Raghubir Singh vs State of Ajmer, [1959] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 478, applied.
On a true construction of section 3 of the Amending Act, the second proviso to section 4(h) cannot be retrospective in operation and therefore, in respect of an order of annulment made by the Collector before the Amending Act came into force the previous sanction obtained from the State Government would be sufficient, but subsequent confirmation by the State Government would be necessary in the case of an order made after the Amending Act came into force.
