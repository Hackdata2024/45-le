Section 66(1)(0) of the C. P. and Berar Municipalities Act, 1922, empowered the municipalities to impose "a terminal tax on goods or animals imported into or exported from the limits of a municipality".
The respondent framed rules for the imposition of terminal tax.
The appellant transported bales of cotton from Yeotmal to Nagpur by road and the vehicles carrying the goods passed through the limits of respondent municipality.
The goods were neither unloaded nor reloaded at Wardha bat were merely carried across through the municipal area.
The respondent collected terminal tax on these goods on the ground that they were exported by the appellant from the limits of the respondent municipality.
The appellant disputed his liability to pay terminal tax, and claimed a refund : Held, that the goods which were in transit and were merely carried across the limits of the municipality were not liable to terminal tax.
Terminal tax on goods imported into or exported 1103 from the limits of a municipality was payable on goods on their journey ending within the municipal limits or commencing therefrom and not where the goods were merely in transit and had their terminus elsewhere.
Terminal tax leviable under section 66(1)(o) must have reference to some activity within the municipal area i.e., the entry for the purpose of remaining within that area or the commencement of the journey from that area.
The words "imported into" do not merely mean "bringing into"but comprise something more i.e., incorporating and mixing up of the goods with the mass of the property in the local area.
Similarly, the words "exported from" do not merely indicate, "taking out" but have reference to the taking out of goods which ' had become part and parcel of the mass of the property of the local area and will not apply to goods in transit i.e. brought into the area for the purpose of being transported out of it.
