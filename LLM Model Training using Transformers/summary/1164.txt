The Industrial Tribunal, on a reference under section 12 Of the , framed a gratuity scheme for the appellant company.
The company challenged the validity of some of the provisions of the scheme on the grounds, inter alia, (1) that the scheme was framed on the basis of the units, while it should have been done on industry cum region basis, (2) that the scheme provided for the award of gratuity on the retirement or resignation of a workmen after ten years ' service instead of fixing the period as fifteen years, and (3) that cl.
(ii)(b) of the scheme which provided that if a workman was dismissed or discharged for misconduct causing financial loss to the works, gratuity to the extent of the loss should not be paid to the workman concerned, was erroneous, because, on principle, misconduct put a blot on the character/of his service and that disqualified him from any claim of gratuity.
Held:(1) that industry cum region basis is not the only basis on which a gratuity scheme could be framed and one framed on the basis of the units cannot be challenged as in valid.
The Bharatkhand Textile Manufacturing Co. Ltd. vs The Textile Labour Association, Ahmedabad, ; , explained.
(2) that the clause in the scheme prescribing ten years ' minimum service to enable an employee to claim gratuity is valid.
The Express Newspapers (P.) Ltd. vs Union of India, , explained.
(3) that gratuity is not paid to an employee gratuitously or merely as a matter of boon, but is paid to him for the service rendered by him to the employer; consequently he should not be wholly deprived of the benefit thus earned by long and meritorious service even though at the end of such service he might have been found guilty of misconduct which entailed his dismissal.
Accordingly, cl.
(ii)(b) of the scheme is a valid provision.
