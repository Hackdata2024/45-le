The appellant was driving his auto scooter rikshaw which on account of a sudden turn taken by the appellant struck a truck.
After the impact the appellant lost control of his scooter rickshaw and crashed into a tree.
As a result a man and a woman received simple in juries and the child whom the woman was holding in her arms received fatal injuries.
The appellant and the truck driver were charged under section 304A of the Indian Penal Code and were convicted by the trial court.
The Additional Sessions Judge allowed the appeal of the truck driver but held the appellant guilty.
On revision a single Judge of the High Court confirmed the conviction of the appellant.
In appeal to this Court by special leave.
HELD : (i) According to the findings of the three courts below the appellant suddenly turned to the right without paying proper heed to the truck coming from the opposite direction and in doing so he was both rash and negligent.
Under article 136 of the Constitution this Court would not like to appraise the evidence again for determining how far the concurrent conclusion of the three ,court below upholding the appellant 's act as rash and negligent was justified.
[207H] (ii) The criminal proceeding against the appellant had gone on for a little more than 8 years.
The circumstances in which the collision between the truck and the appellant 's scooter occurred seemed prima facie to suggest that both the drivers were to blame.
Harassment of a criminal trial for more than 8 years and the expense which the appellant must have incurred could legitimately be taken into account when considering the question of sentence to be imposed by this Court at this point of time.
[208F] [Sentence of imprisonment reduced to period already undergone.
The Court also observed that the investigation of the case was not conducted on scientific lines and that the undue delay in the disposal of the case was a matter of concern.]
