Under a registered will, mortgagee rights in certain proper ty were bequeathed to the appellants.
They filed a suit to recover the money on the basis of the mortgage without obtaining probate of the will.
The respondents challenged the locus standi of the appellants to sue.
The trial Court decreed the suit holding that the will being registered there was a presumption of due execution.
On appeal the High Court dismissed the suit on the ground that attestation of the will by two witnesses had not been proved.
Thereaf ter probate of the will was obtained in favour of the appel lants and their mother.
In appeal before the Supreme Court appellants made an application for the admission of the probate as additional evidence and for making their mother a party.
The respondents opposed the application.
Held, that the Supreme Court has the power to admit addi tional evidence in appeal.
In deciding an appeal the Su preme Court has to take the circumstances as they are at the time when the appeal is being decided, and the probate being a judgment in rem must be taken into consideration.
The objection that the respondents were not parties to the probate proceedings is unsustainable because of the nature of the judgment itself.
Inderjit Pratap Sahi vs Amar Sinah, L. R. (1923) 50 I. A. 183, Lachmeshwar Prasad Shukul vs Kishwar Lal Chaudhuri, , followed.
