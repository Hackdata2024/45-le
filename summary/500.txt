The respondent was a company incorporated in the former Patiala State with its registered office in the territory of Pepsu, a Part B State.
For the assessment years 1948 49 and 1949 50 in respect of the amounts of income tax and super tax which it failed to deduct from out of the remuneration paid to its managing agents, the Income tax Officer took action under the provisions of section 18 of the Patiala Income tax Act.
The Act did not provide for an appeal against the orders of the Income tax Officer under that section and the question for determination was whether an appeal lay under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, which was extended to all Part B States with effect from April 1, 1950, by section 13 of the Finance Act, 1950, and section 2(14A) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922: Held, that the result of the extension of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, to Part B States was that that Act was applicable to the assessment years 1950 51 and subsequent years and that for the assessment years 1948 49 and 1949 50 the law applicable was the Patiala Income tax Act.
Accordingly, an appeal against the order of the Income tax Officer in question was not competent.
