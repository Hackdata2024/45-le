It is not correct to say that section 79 of the , standardises the grant of annual leave with wages to employees to whom the Act applies and that neither the employer by voluntary agreement nor the Industrial Tribunal by its award can vary that standard.
It is well settled that in construing the provisions of a welfare legislation, such as the Act in question which has for its object the preservation of the health, safety and welfare of the workmen, courts should apply the rule of beneficent construction and moreover, sections 78 and 84 of the Act put it beyond doubt that section 79(1) is not intended to standardise annual leave with wages by providing the maximum.
Rightly construed section 78(1) of the Act not only protects past laws, awards, agreements and contracts but also those that are to come into existence in the future and does not prohibit a more generous agreement than that prescribed by section 79(1).
Likewise the scope of section 84 of the Act which, in empowering the State to exempt a factory from all or any provisions of Ch.
VIII of the Act, contemplates better amenities than those guaranteed by the Chapter, cannot be limited to benefits existing at the date of the Act but must also apply to future benefits which an employer may grant to his employees.
Consequently, in a case where the Industrial Tribunal, on a consideration of awards and agreements between employers and employees in comparable concerns, awarded annual leave in excess of what is prescribed by section 79(1), Held, that the award was not open to challenge.
Held, further, that the distinction generally made between operatives doing manual work and clerical and other staff is perfectly justifiable and so the award of privilege leave to the clerical staff could not be said to be discriminatory.
Although the Industrial Tribunals in awarding privilege leave or sick leave must not fail to consider their effect on production and so on the interest of the community in general, this Court would be reluctant under article 136 of the Constitution to interfere with an award unless its provisions are unsustainable on any reasonable grounds and make a violent departure from the practice and trend prevailing in comparable concerns.
