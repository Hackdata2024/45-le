[459C D] 2.
An order of the Supreme Court is not an inconsequen tial order.
If the detaining authority has considered the order of Supreme Court, one cannot state with definiteness which way is subjective satisfaction would have reacted.
This order could have persuaded the detaining authority to desist from passing the order of detention since Supreme Court had allowed freedom of movement.
Detention is only a preventive Act.
The Supreme Court did not find it necessary to restrict the liberty of Ramlal when the order on the stay application was passed.
It may also be that the detaining authority after considering the order of the Supreme Court carefully could still feel, that an order of detention is necessary with reference to other materials which outweigh the effect of Supreme Court 's order.
In all these cases, non application of mind 456 on a vital and relevant material need not necessarily lead to the conclusion that application of mind on such materials would, always be in favour of the detenu.
Application of mind in such cases is insisted upon to enable the detaining authority to consider one way or the other, as to what effect a relevant material could have, on the authority that decides the detention.
The absence of consideration of this important document amounts to non application of mind on the part of the detaining authority rendering the detention order invalid.
