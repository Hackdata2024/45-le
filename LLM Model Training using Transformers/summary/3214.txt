The appellant was appointed on 20 May, 1965, on two years ' probation.
On 1 July, 1967 there was an order extending the period of probation by one year.
On May 20, 1968, there was an order terminating the services of the petitioner.
On July 20, 1968 there was an order revoking the order of termination and extending the period of probation for six months from 20th May, 1968.
The order of termination was on Jan. 30, 1969.
This order recited that, having considered him unfit for appointment to the State Police Service the services of the appellant are dispensed with on the expiry of his extended period of probation.
Two contentions were raised by the appellant in the High Court.
First, the order of termination was passed on Jan. 30, 1969, when the petitioner.
by reason of expiry of 3 years stood confirmed on 19/20 November, 1968 and Second, the order of termination was one of punishment and the appellant should have been given an opportunity to show cause against the order of termination under Rule 9 of the Punjab Civil Service (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1952.
These contentions were rejected by the High Court.
Hence the appeal to this Court by Special Leave.
Dismissing the appeal, HELD: The object of extending the period of probation is to find out whether the appellant was a fit person.
The appellant could not be confirmed, till the period of probation expired.
It cannot, therefore, be held that the appellant stood confirmed on 19/20 November, 1968 before the period of probaition expired in January, 1969.
[776A B] (2) Termination on account of unsatisfactory record will attract rule 9 of the Punishment Rules.
Fitness was a matter to be considered at the time of confirmation.
The order terminating the services is unfitness for appointment and not on the ground of any turpitude to attract Rule 9 of the Punishment Rules, 1952.
To hold that the words "unfit to be appointed" mentioned in the order of termination, are a stigma, would deprive the authorities to judge fitness 'for work or suitability to a post at the time of confirmation.
Termination of services on account of inadequacy for the job or for any tompramental or other defect not involving moral turpitude is not a stigma which can be called discharge by punishment.
Fitness for the job is one.
of the most important reasons for confirmation.
The facts and circumstances do not show that there was any stigma attached to the order of termination and therefore, Rule 9 of the Punjab Civil Service (Punishment & Appeal) Rules, 1952 is not attracted in the present case.
