118 persons were prosecuted for participation in a serious riot.
5 accused were discharged by the Committing Magistrate.
The Additional Sessions Judge acquitted 61 accused and convicted 52 under section 147 and sentenced them to 2 years ' rigorous imprisonment.
The appellant was held guilty under section 304(1) read with 149 and sentenced to 5 years rigorous imprisonment, under section 325/149 sentenced to 2 years rigorous imprisonment and under section 323/149 sentenced to a month 's rigorous imprisonment.
The convicted persons and the State filed appeals before the High Court.
Tile High Court convicted 14 persons including the appellant and altered his conviction under section 304/1/149 into 302/149 for the murder of 3 persons and sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment.
The Learned Counsel for the appellant before this Court contended that the appellant did not participate in the riot.
HELD : This Court is unable to disturb the concurrent findings of the two courts below about appellant 's participation in the riot.
The High Court however, was wrong in holding that the common object of the unlawful assembly was necessarily to cause death of three individuals.
In a case like the present there were two factions; one of the oppressors and the other of the opp ressed, and the intention of members of the oppressed faction could be initially, to demonstrate quite lawfully.
The circumstances showed that the appellant 's intention may have been confined to joining a procession for purposes of protest.
If it is doubtful that the common object of the unlawful assembly was to cause death, persons other than those who actually committed the acts resulting in death could not be held vicariously liable for murder.
