Disposing of on 30.8.1988 Writ Petitions Nos. 8209 and 8821 of 1983 this Court had come to the conclusion that the entire mining operation in the Doon Valley should come to a halt excepting in the case of a selected few, for reasons indicated in that order.
Since then from time to time sever al applications had been moved by the ex lessees seeking permission for removing the stacked material or extension of time for appropriating the mined material.
In allowing or rejecting each such application this Court has been express ing itself clearly that the Doon Valley should be made available for afforestation to make good the loss caused to the ecology.
By today 's order while disposing of all the pending applications including one fresh Writ Petition in the light of the report of the Monitoring Committee appointed by this Court, the Court, HELD: No application either for original permission or for extension of time shall hereafter be entertained by this Court and the Registry is directed by this order not to entertain such petitions.
It may be that such direction may affect some one who has not been vigilant or has on account of some other difficulty or hardship not been able to remove the stacked material within his leasehold area in the Doon Valley; but taking the broad interest of the entire Valley into account such individual losses or inconveniences have to be sacrificed and/or overlooked and equities can no longer be allowed to be invoked.
[76A B] A detailed report on the afforestation scheme may now be placed by the Monitoring Committee by 30th June, 1990 for consideration of the Court on 23rd July, 1990.
The rehabili tation scheme which has already been furnished by the appro priate committee should also be 73 placed before the Court for orders on the said date.
