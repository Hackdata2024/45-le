The appellant, a commissioned officer in the Indian Air Force, on a General Court Martial was cashiered and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six years.
Later the Central Government remitted the unexpired portion of the punishment of rigorous imprisonment.
Subsequently, he was appointed by the Indian Institute of Technology for a project work on a purely temporary basis and subject to verification of his character and antecedents from the Government and subject to the further condition that his services could be terminated on 24 hours notice in writing by either side.
On a reference by the I.I.T., the Ministry of Defence by its letter dated November 19, 1977 invited attention to the Ministry of Home Affairs Memorandum dated May 14, 1965 to the effect that persons who were dismissed from service were disqualified from future employment under the Government but left it open to the I.I.T. whether it would follow that principle in the case of the appellant.
The Professor under whom the appellant was working recommended the retention of the appellant in service.
The I.I.T. did not accept the said recommendation and by its order dated January 21,1978 terminated the appellant 's services on the expiry of 24 hours.
A writ petition filed by the appellant challenging the validity of the said order was dismissed in limine by the Delhi High Court and hence the appeal by special leave.
Dismissing the appeal, the Court, ^ HELD: The relief claimed by the appellant for reinstatement to his post in the Institute must be denied for the reasons, namely, (a) the appointment was temporary only and could be terminated on 24 hours notice; (b) the Professor incharge of the project passed away subsequently in June 1978 and, therefore, the project in which he was engaged was finally closed and (c) the period for which the appellant 's post of Senior Research Assistant had been, created had come to an end.
