The appellant was convicted by the Sessions Judge under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and the conviction was upheld by the High Court.
According to the prosecution evidence the appellant was trying to assault one D when the latter 's brother K intervened.
The appellant took out a knife and caused an injury on K 's thigh which cut an artery and resulted in his death.
In appeal, by special leave, before this Court it was urged that in the circumstances of the case the intention and knowledge requisite for an offence under section 302 I.P.C., had not been established.
HELD: (i) The appellant had not used the knife while he was engaged in the fight with D.
It was only when he felt that the deceased also came up against him that . he whipped out the ' knife.
The deceased was at that time in a crouching position.
In these circumstances it could not be said that the appellant intended to cause the injury in the thigh knowing that it would cut the artery.
It was, therefore, not possible to apply cl. 3 of section 300 to the act of the accused, and he was not guilty of murder.

(ii) However, when the appellant struck the deceased with the knife, he must have known that the deceased then being in a bent position, the blow would land in the abdomen or near it a vulnerable ' part of the human body and that such a blow was likely to result in his death.
In these circumstances it would be quite legitimate to hold that he struck the deceased with the knife with the intention to cause an injury likely to cause death.
The offence, therefore.
clearly fell under section 304 Part 1.
