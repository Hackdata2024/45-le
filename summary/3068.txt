Against the order of the appellant company dismissing him, an employer filed an application before the Labour Court under section 78 of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946.
The Labour Court set aside the order.
The Industrial Court and the High Court confirmed the order of the Labour Court rejecting the appellant 's contention that the order of the Labour Court was liable to be set aside on the ground that the employee did not make an application under section 42(4) in Chapter VIII of the Act ' which was a condition precedent to approaching the Labour Court.
On the question whether the Labour Court could exercise jurisdiction under section 78(1) D of the Act in a case where the employee of an industry governed by the Act had not complied with the provisions of sub section (4) of section 42 of the Act read with the proviso to the sub section, HELD:Allowing the appeal.
(i) The scheme of Chapter VIII of the Act is that in regard to any "Change" in an industrial matter there must be compliance with the provisions of that chapter.
There is nothing in the Act which warrants the conclusion that the legislature by inserting paragraph D in section 78(i) intended to chalk out a wholly different course of action to that prescribed in Chapter VIII dealing with changes.
The ,scheme of section 78 (1) is that Labour Court is to have power to decide all the disputes covered by paragraph A.
In other words, efforts must first be made by the employer intending to effect any change in respect of matters covered by section 42(1), or an employee desiring a change in respect of any order passed by the employer under standing order which would of necessity include an order of dismissal, to see whether it was possible to come to any agreement and an application to the Labour Court could only be resorted to after efforts had been made to settle the dispute and no agreement had been arrived at.
[739C G] (ii) A person who is dismissed would, be an employee within the meaning of section 3(13) of the Act and there is no valid reason for differentiating the case of a dismissed employee from one who complains of some other change.
