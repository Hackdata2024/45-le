The appellant was the owner of the suit land.
Alleging that the 2nd respondent, who was the Mahant of an Akhara, was the occupancy tenant and that he had allowed his lessee to dig it up and rendered it unfit for cultivation, the appellant evicted the 2nd respondent from a part of the land in 1940, and from the rest of it in 1943.
In 1950, the 2nd respondent was removed from the office of Mahant, in proceedings under section 92, C.P.C., and in 1953, the 1st respondent was appointed in his place.
In 1957 the 1st respondent filed a suit for possession of the land, alleging that the Akhara itself was the occupancy tenant.
The trial court decreed the suit and the High court confirmed the decree.
In the appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that the suit was barred by limitation.
HELD: Upon the eviction of the 2nd respondent the occupancy right in the land merged in the right of ownership of the appellant.
Apart from it, the actual physical possession of the land having been continuously with the appellant to the exclusion of the occupancy tenant, whether it was the 1st respondent or the Akhara itself, for a period of more than 12 years before the institution of the suit, the occupancy right was extinguished.
If the 2nd respondent represented the Akhara in the eviction proceeding the decrees therein would bind the 1st respondent as his successor.
If the 2nd respondent did not represent the Akhara, the possession of the appellant under those decrees would be adverse to the Akhara.
The 2nd respondent as the Mahant, or the Receiver appointed by the Court In the section 92 proceedings, could have filed a suit on behalf of the Akhara, and so, the 1st respondent 's suit after 12 years of adverse possession by the appellant was barred.
