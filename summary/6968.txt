The respondent in the appeal after due selection by the State Public Service Commission was appointed in 1965 as a Superintendent in a Deaf Mute and Blind School.
He was thereafter promoted and posted as Deputy Director, and in 1989 he was further promoted to the rank of Joint Director in the Social Welfare Department.
He completed the age of 58 years in January, 1991 when according to the decision of the appellant he had to retire.
According to the Rules FR 56, Sub Rule (1 a) the age of retirement in the department was 58 years excepting for teachers who were to continue in service till 60.
The respondent assailed the order of retirement before the State Administrative Tribunal relying upon the Explanation to the Rule which allowed his claim to continue in service upto the age of 60 years and held that he cannot be retired at 58 years.
In the State 's appeal to this Court, it was contended that the post of Superintendent in Deaf Mute and Blind School to which the respondent was initially appointed in 1965 was not a `teaching post ' and he could not therefore claim the benefit of the Explanation to the Rule.
Allowing the appeal, this Court, HELD :1.
The parties to the appeal have referred to and relied upon the advertisement No. 9/1965 issued by the State Public Service Commission inviting applications for appointment to the posts of Superintendent Deaf Mute and Blind School.
Paragraph 3 thereof mentions the duties attached to the post, and when examined closely, indicate that they were supervisory in nature and not teaching.
The Explanation to the Rule therefore does not come to the aid of the respondent and he was therefore rightly retired on 31.1.1992.

The Original Application filed by the respondent before the State Administrative Tribunal is therefore dismissed.
In case the respondent was paid for performing any duty after the date of his retirement, he shall not be asked to refund the same.
