Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court ^ HELD: If man and woman who live as husband and wife in society are compelled to prove, after half a century of wedlock by eye witness evidence that they were validly married fifty years earlier, few will succeed.
` A strong presumption arises in favour of wed lock where the partners have lived together for a long spell as husband and wife.
Although the presumption IS rebuttable, a heavy burden lies on him who seeks to deprive the relationship of its legal origin.
Law leans in favour of legitimacy and frowns upon bastardy.
