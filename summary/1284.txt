The respondent was prosecuted for an offence under section 8 of the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956, and a charge sheet was presented before a First Class Magistrate in Delhi by a sub inspector, who, as the officer in charge of the Police Station, had investigated the case.
On an objection raised by the respondent, the Magistrate quashed the charge sheet on the ground that only the special police officer appointed under the Act was competent to investigate the offences under the Act.
Held, (Mudholkar, J., dissenting), that since the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956, created new offences and prescribed the procedure for dealing with them, it was a complete code in itself and to that extent the provisions of the Act must prevail over those of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898; that as the Act provided for the appointment of a special police officer for dealing with offences under the Act in the area within his jurisdiction, he and his assistant police officers were the only persons who could investigate offences under the Act committed within that area, and that police officers not specially appointed as special police officers could not 695 investigate the offences under the Act even though they were cognizable offences.
per Mudholkar, J. A special police officer appointed under the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956, and empowered to deal with offences under the Act under section 13(1) derives the power to investigate into such offences not from that section but only under section 551.
of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Even assuming that the words "deal with offences".
in section 13(1) confer upon a special police officer the power to investigate into an offence under the Act and present a charge sheet, the powers of an officer in charge of a station house within whose jurisdiction an offence under the Act has been committed are not excluded by any of the provisions of the Act.
