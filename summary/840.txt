The unskilled seasonal workmen of the Bihar Sugar Industry, bulk of whom belonged to the landless labourer class, who ceased to have any contractual relation with the employers once the 990 season was over and on the commencement of the next season might or might not rejoin their employment) raised disputes over the question whether retaining allowances should be paid to them during the off season.
The Labour Appellate Tribunal inter alia awarded a retaining allowance to unskilled workmen, at a rate of 5% of the basic wage for the period of the off season to be paid every year at the beginning of the season, when they reported for duty.
The main contentions on behalf of the employer were that.
agriculture was the primary occupation of these persons and the employment in the Sugar Factory Was merely a subsidiary occupation, that claim for retaining allowance was really in the nature of unemployment relief which it was the duty of the State and not the industry to give, that the relationship of employer and employee did not exist in the off season and so no payment of anything in the character of wages could possibly be claimed by the labour.
Held, that the relief of unemployment by arranging suitable alternative employment or an alleviation of the distress of employment insurance benefits or by other modes though is primarily the function of the Government of the country, yet the industry where these workmen are seasonally employed cannot look unconcerned and play no part in alleviating the distress of the people who have contributed to the prosperity of the industry by their labour though only for a part of the year.
In deciding whether the principle of social justice which it is the aim of industrial adjudication to apply to justify the payment of retaining allowance to unskilled workmen in these sugar industries it is necessary to take into account.
(a) opportunities of alternative employment in the off season that will be available to such workmen; (b) the degree in which such workmen can be said to have become attached to the particular factory where they work; (c) the likely benefit to the industry if such workmen are induced to return to the factory by the incentive of retaining allowance to be paid when the season commences; (d) the capacity of the industry to bear the burden of retaining allowance.
Held, further, that for alleviating the distress of unskilled workmen in these Sugar Factories, a much better course will be to raise the wage structure with an eye to this fact that for a part of the off season at least when they remain unemployed than to pay retaining allowance for the entire off season.
In the instant case the interests of both the employers and labour will be best served if the question of raising their wages in view of the seasonal nature of their employment be raised before the wage board which has been entrusted with the task of fixing the wages of the workmen concerned in the present dispute, which will be considered sympathetically, specially as the employers have recognised the reasonableness of the claim, 991
