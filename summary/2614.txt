One B, a Brahmin Karnam, executed a will in 1903 authorising his 'widow to adopt.
After his death, the widow adopted R in 1904.
The first respondent was R 's adopted son.
R died in 1950, and his adoptive mother died in 1952.
During his lifetime, R was recognised by every member of the family as the adopted son of B, and he was registered as the Karnam and he acted as the Karnam till his death.
In 1953, the appellant, claiming to be the nearest heir of B filed a suit for recovery of possession of B 's property contending that R 's adoption was invalid, because, the adoptive mother had not attained the age of discretion at the .time of the adoption and was therefore not competent to make the adop tion.
The suit was dismissed.
In appeal to this Court, HELD : Where there is a lapse of several years between the adoption and its being questioned, the burden rests heavily upon him who challenges it, and every allowance for the absence of evidence to prove it must be favourably entertained.
[303 D E] In the present case, having regard to the long lapse of time, the recognition of R as, the adopted son of B, and the fact that those who could have given evidence in favour of the adoption had passed away, a strong presumption in favour of the validity of adoption should be drawn.
The appellant made no attempt to produce the certified copy of the register of births which would have shown, the exact age of the mother and thus failed to rebut the presumption.
