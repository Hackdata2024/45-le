Purporting to act under r. 6.4 of the Punjab Civil Service Rules.
the State imposed a cut of 5 per cent on the pension and death cum retirement gratuity of the respondent.
who was a retired Government servant, on the ground that his service record was not satisfactory.
The High Court allowed the respondent 's writ petition challenging the decision of the Government.
Dismissing the appeal of the State.
^ HELD: The ground that superannuation pension is a bounty and is given as an act of grace is not available to the appellant.
In Deoki Nandan Prasad vs The State of Bihar, [1971] Supp.
S.C.R. 634, it was held by this Court (1) that pension is not a bounty payable on the sweet will and pleasure of the Government and the right of a Government servant to receive it is property under article 31 ( 1 ) of the Constitution.
and so the State cannot withhold the same by a mere executive order: and (2) the claim to pension is property under article 19 (1) (f) of the Constitution and is not saved by cl.
(5) of article 19.
[362C D] (2) Though the impugned order imposing the cut in pension and gratuity is not one of reduction in rank falling within the purview of article 311(2), yet there can be no doubt that it adversely affected the respondent and such an order could not have been passed without giving him a reasonable opportunity of making his defence.
[362G] State of Punjab vs K. R. Erry & Sobhag Rai Mehta [19731 2 S.C.R. 405, applied.
(3) M. Narasimachar vs The State of Mysore [1960] 1 S.C.R. 981, is inapplicable to this case because the point as to whether an opportunity to show cause was to be afforded to a retired Government servant before applying the cut in his pension in view of the principle of natural justice of audi alteram partem was never urged or gone into in that case, nor was the question whether pension was a bounty or property arose in that case.
