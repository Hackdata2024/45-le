The appellant, who was the decree holder, applied for the execution of the decree.
The Sub Divisional Officer, Military Engineering Service, was in possession of some movable property of the judgment debtor.
The Court ordered attachment under 0.
XXI, r. 46(1), Civil Procedure Code by prohibiting the Sub divisional Officer from handing over the property to the judgment debtor.
Thereafter, in stead of following the proper price(lure which was to sell the property under O.XXI, r. 64 and then pass an order for its delivery under O.XXI, r. 79(2), the Court ordered the Sub divisional Officer to produce the property, and, when it was not produced, proceeded under section 145 of the Code treating the Union of India as the principal judgment debtor.
HELD: Section 145 of the Code was not applicable to the cage.
That section only applies when a person becomes liable as a surety and the execution Court was wrong in holding that the Sub divisional Officer became a surety simply because attachment had been made by the prohibitory order under O.XXI, r. 46(1).
