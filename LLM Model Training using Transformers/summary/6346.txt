In this appeal by special leave brought by the auction purchaser against the Judgment of the Madras High Court the sole question for consideration is as regards the period of limitation for making a deposit to make an application under Rule 89 of Order XXI of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 to set aside the sale of immovable property sold in execution of a decree.
Whether the deposit is to be made within 30 days from the date of the sale as required by sub rule (2) of Rule 92 of Order XXI or within 60 days from the date of sale as provided in Article 127 of the ? Following its earlier decision in Thangammal & Ors. vs V.K. Dhanalakshmi & Anr.
and the decision of this Court in Basavantappa vs Gangadhar Narayan Dharwadkar & Anr., the High Court had held that Article 127 governed the period of limitation to make a deposit in terms of Rule 89.
Setting aside the judgment of the High Court on the question of limitation, this Court in allowing the appeal, HELD: The correct construction of Rule 92(2) of Order XXI of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 leads to the irresist ible conclusion that the time for making a deposit in terms of Rule 89 of Order XXI is 30 days, and Article 127 of the prescribing the period for making an application under Rule 89 has no relevance to the prescribed time for making the deposit.
Neither provision has any effect on the other as to time.
