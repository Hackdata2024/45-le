Under section 33(1) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, each nomination paper should be "subscribed" by a proposer and a seconder.
Where the proposer and the seconder of a nomination paper (as in the present case) are illiterate and so place thumb marks instead of signatures and those thumb marks are not attested, the nomination paper is invalid as attestation in the prescribed manner in such a case is necessary because of rule 2(2) of the Representation of the People (Conduct of Elections and Election Petitions) Rules, 1951, which requires it.
Signing, whenever signature is necessary, must be in strict accordance with the requirements of the Act and where the signature cannot be written it must be authorised in the manner prescribed by the Rules.
62 482 Attestation is not a more technical or unsubstantial requirement within the meaning of section 36(4) of the Act and cannot be dispensed with.
The attestation and the satisfaction must exist at the presentation stage and a total omission of such an essential feature cannot be subsequently validated at the scrutiny stage any more than the omission of a candidate to sign at all could have been.
Section 36 of the Act is mandatory and enjoins the Returning officer to refuse any nomination when there has been "any failure to comply with any of the provisions of section 33."
