The title of the petitioner to succeed to the jagir as the next heir of his father who died in July 1946 was recognised and a renewal granted in his favour by the Government by an order dated March 8, 1952.
Section 190 of the Marwar Land Revenue Act, imposed an obligation on the succeeding heir to 1949, execute within one month of the communication to him of the order a kabuliyat for payment of hukammama and other fees according to the scale of fees prescribed under the Act, and the amount payable by the petitioner thereby which came to Rs. 30,000 was demanded by the respondent State.
In the meantime, the Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of jagirs Act, 1952, had been passed and came into force on February 16, 1952, and section 4(a) of this Act enacted that "the liability of all jagirdars to pay tribute to the Government under any existing jagir Law shall cease", while "tribute" was defined by section 2(r) in the following terms .
"Tribute ' in relation to a jagir, includes rekh, rakam, chatund, chakri or other charge of a similar nature".
The petitioner challenged the legality of the demand on the ground that the liability to pay hukamnama was a tribute within the meaning of that word in section 4(a).
Held, that notwithstanding that the definition of the ex pression "tribute" in section 2(r) of the Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of jagirs Act, 1952, is inclusive, on an examination of the meaning of the word as used in the operative provisions of the Act, it could refer only to recurring payments which could be said to be attributable to particular years and not to the type of ad hoc payments of which hukamnama was an example.
Accordingly, the liability to pay hukamnama is not compre hended within the expression "tribute" under section 4(a), and, consequently, was not extinguished by the provisions of the Rajasthan Act of 1952.
