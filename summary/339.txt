Where the respondent in an election petition contended that the allegations in the election petition were vague and wanting in particulars, but did not call for any particulars which it was open to him to do and was not found to have been misled or in any way prejudiced in his defence, it was not open to him to contend that the petition was liable to be dismissed for non compliance with the provisions of section 83 of the Act.
Clauses (a) and (b) of the proviso to section 99 of the Representation of the People Act read together leave no scope for doubt that clause (a) contemplates notice only to such persons as were not parties to the election petition and it is, therefore, not obligatory on the Tribunal under cl.
(a) to issue notices on such persons as were parties in order that it may name them for disqualification under sub clause (ii) of section 99(1)(a) of the Act.
Clause (b) to the proviso obviously has the effect of excluding such persons as have already had the opportunity of cross examining witnesses, calling evidence and of being heard, which the clause seeks to afford.
The Indian and the English Law on the matter are substantially the same.
Kesho Ram vs Hazura Singh, [1953] 8 Election Law Reports 320, overruled.
The jurisdiction that sub clause (ii) of section 99(1)(a) of the Act confers on the Tribunal for making recommendation for exemption 458 from disqualifications mentioned in sections 141 to 143 is purely advisory.
Where it omits to do so, aggrieved parties have access to the Election Commission which under section 144 has the power to act suo motu.
No person, be he a party or a stranger, has a right to be heard by the Tribunal on the question of such exemption and, therefore, no question of any service of notice under the proviso in this regard can arise.
Even supposing that the proviso requires notice on a party to the election petition, the notice to him of the election petition itself can be treated as a notice under the proviso.
