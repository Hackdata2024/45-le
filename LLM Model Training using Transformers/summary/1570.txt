The appellant was a servant in the Hyderabad Revenue Service and was holding the post of Deputy Secretary to the Government in the Public Works Department.
The Government of Andhra Pradesh ordered an enquiry by the Tribunal for Disciplinary proceedings.
The Tribunal enquired into the charges and recommended the dismissal of the appellant from service and after due notice to the appellant the Government of Andhra Pradesh ordered his dismissal.
The appellant thereupon moved a petition under article 226 of the Constitution for quashing the aforesaid order, which was dismissed by the High Court.
In this Court it was urged by the appellant that the appointment of Mr. Sriramamurthy was incompetent as he was 672 not qualified to act as the Tribunal of Enquiry under the Hyderabad Act.
Held, that by virtue of section 127 thereof the States Reorgani sation Act applied even if it was inconsistent with anything in the Hyderabad Public Servants Act, 1950.
By reason of section 127 and the power granted by section 122 it was competent to the Government of Andhra Pradesh to name an authority under the Hyderabad Act even though that authority might not have been qualified under the latter Act.
The concluding words of section 122 shew that on the notification issuing under section 122 the existing law itself was to have effect in a different manner.
Section 122 thug made the Hyderabad Act speak in accordance with the notification issued under section 122.
That Act after the notification applied in accordance with the notification and was pro tanto adapted by the Notification.
The adaptation of the Hyderabad Act under section 120 was not a condition precedent to the issuance of the notification and Notification having issued the Hyderabad Act applied accordingly and the appointment of Mr. Sriramamurthy was therefore valid.
