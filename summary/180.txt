The petitioners, who were residents of a municipality, alleging that they had been deprived of their rights to exercise their votes and to seek their election as candidates in certain by elections to the Municipal Board, as those by elections were held on communal lines on the basis of separate electorates contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, applied for writs tinder article 32 of the Constitution for preventing the elected candidates from acting as members of the Board, and the District Magistrate and Civil Judge from holding any meetings of the Board: Held, that, though a law which provides for elections on the basis of separate electorates for members of different religious communities offends against article 15(1) of the Constitution and an election held after the Constitution in pursuance of such a law subject to el. 4 would be void, the right which the petitioners claimed as rate payers in the municipality to insist that the Board should be legally constituted and that persons who have not been properly elected should not be allowed to take part in the proceedings of the Board was outside the purview of article 32 of the Constitution inasmuch as such a right, even if it existed, was not a fundamental right conferred by Part III of the Constitution.
Held further, that the alleged infringement of the fundamental rights of the petitioners under article 15(1) and article 14, that is, the discrimination practised against them related to rights which they in fact never sought to exercise and took no steps to assert while there was occasion for doing so and the petitioners were therefore entitled to no relief under article 32 of the Constitution.
