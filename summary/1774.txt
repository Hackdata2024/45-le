The assesses :started collecting from its customers from the year 1945 besides the price of the liquor and the bottles in which the liquor was sold a further charge called "empty bottles return security deposit.
" The entire sum collected on this account in respect of any one transaction would be refunded in full on return of 90 per cent.
of the bottles covered by it.
The question for consideration before this Court was whether the charge "security deposit" amounted to a trading receipt assessable to Income Tax.
Held: The amounts paid to the assessee and described as 'security deposit ' were trading receipts and therefore income of the assessee assessable to tax.
These amounts were paid as an integral part of the commercial transaction of the sale of liquor in bottles and represented an extra price charged for the bottles.
They were not security deposits as there was nothing to secure, there being no right to the return of bottles.
These appeals are covered by the judgment of this Court in Punjab Distilling Industries Ltd. vs Commissioner of Income tax.
