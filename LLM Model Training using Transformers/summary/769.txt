The Tribunal dismissed the application whereupon the respondent appealed to the Appellate Tribunal which allowed the appeal and refused permission to retrench.

Held, that the complaint under section 33A of the , is as good as a reference under section 10 of the Act and the Tribunal has all the powers to deal with it as it would have in dealing with a reference under section 10 of the Act and it is open to the Tribunal in proper case to order reinstatement.
