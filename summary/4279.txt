Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court ^ HELD: (1) The legislature has no doubt plenary power in the matter of enactment of statutes and can itself make retrospective laws subject, of course, to the constitutional limitations.
But it is trite law that a delegate cannot exercise the same power unless there is special conferment thereof to be spelled out from the express words of the delegation or by compelling implication.
In the present case the power under Section 4(2) does not indicate either alternative.
Therefore the authority of the State Government under the delegation does not empower it to make retrospective rules.
[629 A B; 630 B] (2) The mere fact that the rules framed had to be placed on the table of the legislature was not enough, in the absence of a wider power in the Section, to enable the State Government to make retrospective rules.
The whole purpose of laying on the table of the legislature the rules framed by the State Government is different.
[629E] Hukum Chand vs Union of India, ; (902), followed.
Observation: The State Government should have been more careful in giving effect to the resolution passed by the legislature and should not have relied upon its delegated powers which did not carry with it the powers to make retrospective rules.
