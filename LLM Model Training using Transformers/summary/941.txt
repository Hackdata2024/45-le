The appellant, a limited company, which was the lessee of a mining lease granted a sub lease in respect of two of the villages comprised in its grant.
The secretary and two of the directors of the company were prosecuted for having contravened the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation & Development) Act, 1948, and the Mineral Concession Rules, 1949, which were framed under it.
The appellant contended, firstly, that the sub lease was not covered by the definition of the term " Mining lease " of the Act and as such the Act and Rules did not apply to a sub lease at all ; and secondly, that as these rules were made under sections 5 and 6 of the Act and not under section 7 they have no application to a sub lease granted by a lessor, even after the coming into force of the Act and the Rules where the lessor 's own lease was of date anterior to the coming into force of the Act and the Rules.
Held, that the definition of " Mining lease " contained in section 3(d) of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1048, does not require that the lessor must be a proprietor and its plain language read with section 5 of the , makes it clear that a mining lease includes one executed by a proprietor as much as a lease executed by the lessee from such proprietor.
The facts that the lessor is himself a lessee, and the transaction between him and the person in whose favour he makes the transfer by way of lease is called a sub lease does not in any way change the nature of the transfer as between them.
Held, further, that the Rules made under sections 5 and 6 of the Act would apply to a mining sub lease if it is made after the Act and the Rules came into force.
