The lands of village Gudur were irrigated by tanks which received water from the Venkatagiri river through the "Gudur anicut system".
The Government proposed to make alterations in the Chennur anicut up the river for supplying water to the Chennur tank for irrigating lands of village Chennur.
The residents of village Gudur filed a suit for a declaration that the Government had no right to alter or extend or add to the Chennur anicut over the river, and stated in the plaint that it was not necessary to ask for a permanent injunction as the Government was bound to give effect to the declaration granted by the Court.
Held, that the suit was barred by section 4 of the Madras irrigation Tanks (Improvement) Act, 1949.
Section 4 provided 309 that no court shall entertain any suit for an injunction to restrain the exercise of any powers conferred on Government by section 3.
Section 3 empowered the Governtnent to "raise the full tank level of any tank or to take any other measures for increasing its capacity or efficiency".
The proposed alterations were within section 3 as they would increase the efficiency of the Chennur tank by making a larger supply of water available within the holding power of the tank.
It was not correct to say that section 3 only authorised improvements in the tank itself or in the supply channels from the tank but not in the anicut.
Though the plaintiffs did not formally ask for an injunction, the suit, in effect, was one for an injunction to restrain the Government from exercising its powers under section 3.
It is clear that the action proposed to be taken by Govern ment was under the powers given under s.3.
The mere fact that no notice as required by r. 5 specifying the nature of the improvement, its cost etc.
was issued did not indicate that the action was not under section 3 nor did it invalidate the order proposing the improvement.
The proposed action had not been taken when the suit was filed and there was still time to publish the notice.
