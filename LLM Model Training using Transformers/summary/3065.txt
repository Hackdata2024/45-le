This Court does not normally reappraise evidence in an appeal under article 136 of the Constitution but that fact would not prevent interference with an order of conviction, if, on consideration of the vital prosecution evidence in the case the Court finds it to be afflicted with ex facie infirmity.
The appellant was sentenced to death under section 302 Indian Penal Code.
The trial Court and the High Court based the conviction of the appellant primarily upon the testimony of two witnesses one of whom according to the prosecution case was present when the accused made murderous assault on the deceased and the other arrived soon after.
Neither of them nor anyone else who was told about the occurrence by the two witnesses made any report at the police station for more than 20 hours after the occurrence even though the police station was only two miles from the place of occurrence.
Setting aside the conviction, HELD : That the delay in lodging the report would raise considerable doubt regarding the varacity of the evidence of two witnesses and point to an infirmity in that evidence and would render it unsafe to base the conviction of the apPellant.
The first information report in a criminal case is an extremely vital and valuable piece of evidence for the purpose of corroborating the oral evidence adduced a ' the trial The object of insisting upon prompt lodging of the report to the police in respect of commission of an offence is to obtain early information regarding the circumstances in which the crime was committed, the names of the actual culprits and the part played by them as well as, the names of eye witnesses present at there scene of occurrence.
Delay in lodging the first information report quite often results in embellishment which is a Creature of after thought.
It is therefore essential that the delay in lodging the report should be satisfactorily explained.
