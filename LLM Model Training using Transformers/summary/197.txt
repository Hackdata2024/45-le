The West Bengal Land Development and Planning Act, 1948, passed primarily for the settlement of immigrants who had migrated into West Bengal due to communal disturbances in East Bengal provides for the acquisition and development of land for public purposes including the purpose aforesaid: Held, that the provisions of section 8 of the West Bengal Act XXI of 1948 making the declaration of the Government.
conclusive as to the public nature of the purpose of the acquisition and the limitation of the amount of compensation so as not to exceed the market value of the land on December 31, 1946, are ultra vires the Constitution and void 559 (i)inasmuch as article 31(2) of the Constitution made the existence of a public purpose a necessary condition of acquisition, the existence of such a purpose as a fact must be established objectively ; (ii)that in view of the fact that the impugned Act is a permanent enactment and lands may be acquired under it many years after it came into force, the fixing of the market value on December 31, 1946, as the coiling on compensation without reference to the value of the land at the time of acquisition, is arbitrary and cannot be regarded as due compliance in letter and spirit with the requirements of article 31(2) (iii)the Act is not saved by article 31(5) from the operation of article 31(2) as it was not certified by the President as provided for by article 31(6).
Held, further, that while entry No. 42 of List III of the Seventh Schedule confers on the legislature the discretionary power of laying down the principles which should govern the determination of the amount to be given to the owner of the property appropriated, article 31(2) requires that such principles must ensure that what is determined as payable must be "compensation", that is, a just equivalent of what the owner has been deprived of.
Whether such principles take into account all the elements which make up the true value of the property appropriated and exclude matters which are to be neglected is a justiciable issue to be adjudicated by the Court.
