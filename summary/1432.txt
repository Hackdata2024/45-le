The appellants were convicted of offences under section 302 read with section 34 and section 201 read with section 34 Indian Penal Code by the Sessions judge.
On appeal to the High Court there was a difference of opinion between the two judges who heard it and the case was referred under section 429 Code of Criminal Procedure to a third judge.
The third judge upheld the con victions.
The appellants contended that where a case was referred under section 429, the opinion of the judge acquitting the accused had to be treated as a judgment of acquittal and that the third judge must consider all the reasons given by the acquitting judge and his judgment should indicate the reasons for disagreeing with the opinion of the acquitting judge.
The appellants further contended that there were certain circumstances proved by the evidence on the record which showed that the eye witnesses could not be relied upon.
Held, that there was nothing in section 429 which required the third judge to whom the reference was made to act as though he was sitting in appeal against acquittal.
He had to consider the opinion of the two differing judges and to give his own opinion.
Held, further (per Kapur and Das Gupta JJ.
Dayal.
J. contra) that the judgment of the High Court suffered from such infirmities as placing the onus of proof of certain facts on the appellants and using of inadmissible evidence.
The case was full of so many inconsistencies and improbilities and peculiarities that it made it difficult to rely upon the testimony of the eye witnesses and to hold that the case against the appellants was established beyond reasonable doubt.
Per Dayal J.
The circumstances urged by the appellant did not make out a case for interference with the findings of facts of the High Court.
