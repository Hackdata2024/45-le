Allowing the appeal in C.A. No. 2254 of 1968 and dis missing the appeal in C.A. No. 2255 of 1968, the Court.
HELD: (1) A method of assessing damages usually followed in England is to calculate the net pecuniary loss upon an annual basis and "to arrive at a total award by multiplying the figure assessed as the amount of the annual 'dependency ' by a number of year 's purchase", that is, the number of years that benefit was expected to last taking into consid eration the imponderable factors in fixing either the multi plier or the multiplicand.
The husband may not be dependant on the wife 's income.
the basis of assessing the damages payable to the husband for the death of his wife would be similar.
[631 AB] Rule in Mallet vs Mc Mongale 1970 (A.C.) H.L. 166 at 174 quoted with approval.
P.B. Kaclar vs Thatchamma AIR 1970 Kerala 241, approved.
In assessing damages certain other factors have to be taken note of, such as, the uncertainties of life and the fact of accelerated payment that the husband would be getting a lump sum payment which but for his wife 's death would have been available to him in driblets over a number of years.
Allowance must be made for the uncertainties and the total figure sealed down accordingly.
The deceased might not have been able to earn till the age of retirement 628 for some reason or other, like illness or for having to spend more time to look after the family which was expected to grow.
Thus, the amount assessed has to be reduced taking into account these imponderable factors.
[630 G H] In the instant case, the deceased had 35 years of serv ice before her when she died.
The claimant 's loss reasona bly works out to Rs. 50/ a month i.e., Rs. 600/ a year.
Keeping in mind all the relevant factors and contingencies and taking 20 as the suitable multiplier, the figure comes to Rs. 12,000.
The Tribunal 's award cannot, therefore, be challenged as too low though it was not based on proper grounds.
The High Court was also not right in estimating the damages at Rs. 50,000/ in the manner it did.
2255 of 1968: Though the possibility was there, in the instant case, of the deformity being removed by surgical operation when the boy grew up to be 16 years, the other possibility of "likelihood to develop a permanent limp" cannot be altogeth er ruled out.
That being the position, the increase of general damages to Rs. 20,000/ , in the instant case, in addition to Rs. 890/ as special damages is proper.
