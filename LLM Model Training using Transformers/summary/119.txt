Rule 268 of the Madras Motor Vehicles Rules, 1940, as it originally stood did not empower the Transport Authority to alter from time to time the starting places and termini for motor vehicles.
The rule was amended in 1950 so as to empower the Transport Authority to do so, and after giving notice to the appellant who was the owner of a bus stand in a municipality, which was being used for several years as the starting place and terminus for motor buses plying to and from the municipality, the Transport Authority passed a resolution changing the starting place and terminus for the convenience of the public.
The appellant applied for a writ of certiorari contending that r. 268 as amended was ultra vires as it went beyond the rule making powers conferred by section 68 (2) (r) of the and was also repugnant to article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution: Held, (i) that the fixing and alteration of bus stands was not a purpose foreign to the " control of transport vehicles ", the purpose for which rules could be made under section 68 (1), and the power to make rules prohibiting the picking up or setting down of passengers at specified places mentioned in section 68 (2) (r) necessarily included the power to alter the situation of bus stands, and r. 268 as amended did not therefore go beyond section 68 (2) (r) ; (ii) the restriction placed upon the use of the bus stand for the purpose of picking up or getting down passengers to or from outward journeys cannot be considered to be an unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on any profession, trade or business of the appellant, and r. 268 was not in any way repugnant to article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution.
The expression " duly notified stand " in the Madras means a stand duly notified by the Transport Authority.
There is no warrant for the view that it means a stand 291 notified by the municipality.
The provisions of section 270 (b), (c) and (e) do not affect the power of the Transport Authority to regulate traffic control or impose restrictions upon the licence of cart stands.
