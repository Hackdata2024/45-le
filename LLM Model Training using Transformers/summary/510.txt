The word 'shall ' occurring in sub section
(4) Of section 173 and sub section (3) Of section 207A of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not mandatory but directory and a non compliance with the provisions of those subsections, unless it can be shown to have prejudiced the accused person in his defence, cannot invalidate the commitment proceedings or the subsequent trial.
Magistrates holding inquiries under section 207A(3) Of the Code of Criminal Procedure must, however, be circumspect and see that an accused person is not handicapped in his defence by any omission on the part of the Police Officer to furnish him with necessary copies.
Where such non compliance is found to cause any prejudice to the accused, the Court should in the interest of justice reopen the proceedings and insist on a full compliance with the provisions.
When it causes no prejudice, it is a mere irregularity curable under section 537 Of the Code.

284 Consequently, in a case where an accused person was com mitted to the Court of Session on a charge under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and found guilty thereunder by the Sessions judge and awarded the capital sentence and the order of conviction and sentence was unassailable on merits, but the Police Officer had omitted to furnish him copies as required by section 173(4) and the inquiring Magistrate to cause such copies to be furnished to him under section 207A(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and such omission could not be shown to have in any way prejudiced the accused person in his defence, it was a mere irregularity that did not vitiate either the commitment proceedings or the trial and was cured by section 537 Of the Code.
