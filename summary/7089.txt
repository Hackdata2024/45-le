The services of the appellants were terminated by the Management of a recognised school.
The termination was not approved by the Inspector of Schools.
The appellants filed a writ petition before the High Court for reinstatement and salaries from the date the school became an aided institution.
The High Court having dismissed the writ petition, appellants preferred the present appeal.
Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: Section 10 A of the Orissa Education Act provides that the termination of a teacher of an aided institution shall be subject to the approval of the Inspector of Schools.
Use of the word 'aided institution ' is dear indication that the provisions of approval apply only to the aided schools.
Since on the date the services of the appellants were terminated the institution was recognised only and not aided, the Inspector could not have exercised the power of disapproval.
Recognition of a institution for purposes of imparting education is different than bringing It on grants in aid.
To the former the regulatory provisions of the Education Act or the rules do, not apply.
The Education Department has no control either on admission of students or members of staff.
