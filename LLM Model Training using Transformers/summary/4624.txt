The respondent Municipal Board filed a complaint in the trial court against the appellants under section 155 of the U.P. Municipalities Act, 1916 alleging that the appellants had brought by railway on November 30, 1967 at the railway siding in their sugar factory within the limits of the respondent for purposes of consumption or use certain quantity of sugarcane without paying octroi payable under the new bye laws of the respondent published on May 18, 1960.
The appellants pleaded that since the payment of octroi on sugarcane brought by railway at the railway siding situated inside their factory had been exempted by U.P. Government 's order dated November 20, 1936 passed under section 157 (3) of the Act the prosecution should fail.
As the respondent went on seeking adjournments and the case remained undisposed of for nearly four years, the appellants filed a petition under section 561 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 in the High Court for quashing the proceedings on the ground that they were vexatious.
The High Court dismissed the petition observing that after the commencement of the Constitution there has been a material change in the nature of octroi levied under the Act and on account of the framing of the new bye laws the exemption granted under section 157(3) of the Act would no longer be available.
The High Court held that since a petition filed by the appellants challenging the notification containing the new bye laws was earlier dismissed by the High Court it was not open to the appellants now to contend that the exemption granted under the Order of 1936 was still available.
In this appeal the respondent contended that the levy from which exemption had been given by the Order of 1936 was either a terminal tax or a fee and not a tax and since what was being levied as octroi from the year 1960 322 under the new bye laws was a tax, the order of exemption would not be applicable to it.
Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: The respondent was not entitled to collect octroi on sugarcane brought into its municipal limits by the appellants by rail on the relevant date.
[336 B] The word 'octroi ' in section 128(1) (viii) of the Act is found in the group of taxes referred to in section 128.
The sum received by a Municipal Board on account of octroi is also dealt with like any other tax.
There is no element of quid pro quo between the person who pays the octroi and the Municipal Board.
The octroi leviable under entry 49 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935 was not a fee but was a tax.
[332 B C, 335 A] A cess may either be a tax or a fee.
Whether a cess in a given context is a tax or a fee depends upon the purpose for which it is levied.
In entry 49 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Government of India Act, 1935 the expression 'cesses ' is used in the sense of 'taxes '.
In entry 52 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution the expression 'taxes ' is substituted in the place of the expression 'cesses ' which was in the former entry 49 in the Government of India Act, 1935, but the nature and content of the legislative power under both are the same.
[331 C, E F] When tax is clearly levied on goods when they are brought into a local area for purposes of use, sale or consumption, it does not cease to be a tax levied under section 128(1) read with entry 49 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935 merely because the municipalities concerned render no service with regard to it.
G] The Punjab Flour and General Mills Co., Ltd., Lahore vs The Chief Officer, Corporation of the City of Lahore and the Province of the Punjab, ; and The Hingir Rampur Coal Co., Ltd., & Ors.
vs The State of Orissa & Ors., ; referred to.
The octroi which was being levied in 1936 when the exemption was granted and the subsequent levy imposed in the year 1960 are both taxes levied under the Act and fall within the State List both under the Government of India Act, 1935 and under the Constitution.
It was not a terminal tax falling under entry 58 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India, Act, 1935.
It does not also fall under entry 89 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution now.
The said levy came within entry 49 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935 and now falls under entry 52 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.
The exemption granted in the year 1936 should be construed as an exemption from all taxation by way of octroi leviable and levied under the Act on rail borne sugarcane and that exemption would continue until it is either rescinded or modified by the State Government or becomes inapplicable for any other reason.
The new set of bye laws brought into force in 1960 by the Municipal Board though with 323 the sanction of the State Government does not have the effect of rescinding or annulling the exemption granted under section 157(3) by the former Provincial Government.
[330 G, 331, A B, 336 A D] There is no irreconcilable in consistency between notification published in 1960 and the order of exemption made in the year 1936.
While under the Notification of 1960 octroi is payable on the import of sugarcane into municipal limits for purposes of sale, use or consumption, by virtue of the order made in 1936 under section 157(3) sugarcane brought by rail and delivered at the railway siding inside the factory premises alone is exempted from the levy of octroi.
Sugarcane brought by other means of transport would be governed by the notification issued in 1960.
There is no provision in the notification of 1960 to the effect that the said exemption is either withdrawn or that sugarcane brought by rail would be taxable.
[335 C E] The High Court was in error in holding that the order of exemption granted under section 157(3) was the same as any general rule or special order of the State Government referred to in sub section (1) of section 128 subject to which the Municipal Board may impose any tax referred to therein and the effect of the exemption granted in 1936 was also in issue in earlier writ petition.
In that writ petition the said question was neither directly nor constructively in issue.
An exemption becomes operative only when the tax is validly imposed under section 128.
The restriction that may be imposed by any general rule or special order of the State Government under section 128(1) affects the initial power of the Municipal Board to levy a tax.
An order under section 157(3) operates only after a tax is validly imposed with the sanction of the State Government or of the Commissioner as the case may be, as stated in section 133 of the Act.
It is therefore, open to the appellants to contend even after the dismissal of their earlier petition that they are entitled to the limited exemption granted by the Order of 1936.
