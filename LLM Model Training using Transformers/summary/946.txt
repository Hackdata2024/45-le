The respondent was appointed a Sub Inspector on probation in the Orissa Police Force.
A notice was served on him to show cause why he should not be discharged from service " for gross neglect of duties and unsatisfactory work ".
He submitted his explanation and asked for opportunity to cross examine certain witnesses.
The Deputy Inspector General of Police considered the explanation unsatisfactory and passed an order discharging the respondent from service " for unsatisfactory work and conduct ".
The respondent contended that the order was invalid on two grounds: (i) that he was not given a reasonable opportunity to show cause against the proposed action within the meaning of article 311(2), and (ii) that he was not afforded an opportunity to be heard nor was any evidence taken on the charges.
Held, that the order of discharge did not amount to dismis sal and did not attract the protection of article 311(2) of the Constitution and was a valid order.
The services of the respondent, ' who was a probationer, were terminated in accordance with the rules and not by way of punishment.
He had no right to the post held by him and under the terms of his appointment he was liable to be discharged at any time during the period of his probation.
The notice given to the respondent was under Rule 55 B of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules which made it obligatory to give such notice before terminating the services of a probationer.
The enquiry was merely for ascertaining whether he was fit to be confirmed.
