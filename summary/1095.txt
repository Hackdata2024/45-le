The reason for the existence of this fund was that when losses occurred according to the practice they could be charged against " undivided profits ", i.e., profits set apart after provision for expenses and taxes etc.
for continuous use in the business of the Bank.
The appellant contended that in computing the amount for the purpose of " abatement " it was entitled to include the undivided profits " which fell within the word " reserves ".

Held, that the amount designated as " undivided profits was a part of the reserves and had to be taken into account when computing the capital and reserves within Rule 2(1) of Sch.
II of the Business Profits Tax Act, 1947.
