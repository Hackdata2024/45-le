The wages and gratuity of the workers of Metro Theatre were governed by an earlier award in Reference No. 1 of 1968 published in 3 7 1969 which was effective from 1 1 1967, while dearness allowance was governed by the award in Reference No. 440 of 1970 effective from 1 1 1970.
Both these awards were duly terminated by notice and fresh demands for revision of wage scales, dearness allowance, etc.
effective from 1 1 1974 were submitted by the workers Union to the Management on 15 4 1974.
A reference (IT) No. 248 of 1975 was made on 10 7 1975 to the Industrial Tribunal which by its award dated September 22, 1977 published in Maharashtra Government Gazette on November 3, 1977 granted the revision in wage scales and dearness allowance with effect from 1 1 1977.
While granting special leave against the impugned award the Court confined the appeal to three points, namely: (i) retrospectivity of the award: (ii) linkage of dearness allowance to some rational principle and (iii) construction of section 4(5) of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1971.
Allowing the appeal in part on the point of gratuity and remanding to the Tribunal on the question of linkage of dearness allowance, the Court.
^ HELD: 1.
Under section 17A(4) of the it is a matter of discretion for the Tribunal to decide having regard to the circumstances of each case from which date its award should come into operation and no general rule can be laid down as to the date from which the Tribunal should bring its award into force and the Supreme Court shall not interfere with the Tribunal 's order in that behalf unless substantial ground is made out showing unreasonable exercise or its part.
In the instant case, in the absence of any material placed before the Tribunal or even before the Supreme Court by either party as to whether the profits earned by the Company for the years 1974, 1975 and 1976 had been disbursed or were still available with the Company at the time of making the award, a factor relevant on the question of granting retrospectivity and also in view of decreasing trend in the profits made by the Company during the said three years, according to the Exhibit U 5 marked by the appellant Union itself, presumably the Tribunal felt that it would be proper to give the revision in wage scales and dearness allowance only from 1 1 1977 onwards and not to give any retrsopective effect.

On the question of linkage of dearness allowance with some rational principle, uniformity is highly desirable in one and the same industry.
The very same adjudicator, Shri B.B. Tambe, yet in other Reference (VA) No. 1 of 1979 dated June 27, 1980 had awarded payment of dearness allowance linked with the cost living index, while in the instant case, fixed dearness allowance on the normal principle of industry cum region.
[168 C, G H, 169 A] 3:1.
On true construction of section 4(5) of the Payment of Gratuity Act, the expression "award" occurring in the said provision does not mean and cannot be confined to "existing award" but includes any award that would be made by an adjudicator wherein better terms of gratuity could be granted to the employees if the facts and circumstances warrant such grant.
In the first place, there is nothing in the provision which limits the expression "award".
Secondly, it cannot be and was not that under the above provision a gratuity scheme obtaining under existing agreement or contract could be improved upon by a fresh agreement or fresh contract between the employer and the employee and if that be so, there is no reason why the expression "award" should be construed as referring to an existing award and not to include a fresh award that may be made by an adjudicator or an Industrial Court improving in favour of the employees the scheme obtained under the Act or the existing award.
Thirdly, the very fact that under the above provision better terms of gratuity could be obtained by an employee by an agreement or contract with the employer notwithstanding the scheme of gratuity obtaining under the Act clearly suggests that no standardisation of the gratuity scheme contemplated by the Act was intended by the Legislature.
[171 D H, 172 A] 3:2.
It is true that the Payment of Gratuity Act enacts a complete Code containing detailed provision covering all essential features of the scheme for payment.
But it is also clear that scheme envisaged by the enactment secures the minimum for the employees in that behalf and express provisions are found in the Act under which better terms of gratuity if already existing are not merely preserved but better terms could be conferred on the employee in future.

Alembic Chemical Works Company Ltd. vs Its Workmen, , explained.
The phrase "under any award, agreement or contract with employer" occuring in section 4(5) of the Payment of Gratuity Act is intended to cover future awards agreements or contracts with the employer since existing better terms of gratuity are intended to be protected by issuance of a notification under section 5 of the Act.
[173 B C] 166 [To maintain uniformity and to be in conformity with the Award made by the same adjudicator in Reference (VA) No. 5 of 1970 M/s. Alankar and 39 others vs The Workmen employed under them, the Court directed that the gratuity scheme as set out in paragraph 140 of that award be applicable to the workmen of Metro Cinema with effect from 1 1 1970.]
