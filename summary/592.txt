R was appointed Professor of Mathematics in a College affiliated to the Gauhati University.
He was later appointed Principal of the College.
On complaints being made against R the Governing Body of the College held an enquiry and ordered his dismissal as Principal and Professor of Mathematics.
R made representations to the Vice Chancellor of the Gauhati University and the Executive Council of the University appointed a committee to report on the propriety of the action taken.
Upon the report of the committee that there was no reasonable ground justifying the dismissal of R, the Executive Council passed a resolution directing the Governing Body to reinstate R : Held, that the Executive Council acted without jurisdiction in so far as it interfered with the action taken against R as the Principal of the College.
The Gauhati University Act, 1947, and the Statutes framed under section 21(g) thereof made a distinction between a Principal and a teacher.
Clause 3(g)(v) Of the Statutes empowered the Executive Council to interfere only with the action taken by the Governing Body of an affiliated College against a teacher and not with action taken against a Principal.
