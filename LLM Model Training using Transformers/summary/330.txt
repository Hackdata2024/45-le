The appellant in this appeal had been assessed to Income Tax which was reduced on appeal but that assessment was set aside by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal on the ground that the Indian Finance Act of 1939 was not in force during the assessment year in Chota Nagpur.
On a reference by the Tribunal the High Court con firmed the setting aside of this assessment.
By the promulgation of Bihar Regulation IV of 1942 by the Governor of Bihar (which was assented to by the Governor General) the Indian Finance Act of 1939 was brought into force in Chota Nagpur retrospectively as from the 30th March 1939.
On the 8th February 1944 the Income Tax Officer passed an order in pursuance of which a fresh notice was issued under section 34 which resulted in the assessment of the appellant to income tax.
The question for determination in this appeal was whether the notice under section 34 was validly issued.
Held (i) that for the purposes of section 34 of the Act the income, profits or gains sought to be assessed were chargeable to income tax according to the scheme of the Act and the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the Act; (ii) that it was a case of chargeable income escaping assessment within the meaning of section 34 and was not a case of mere non assessment of income tax because the earlier assessment proceedings in the present case had in fact been taken but failed to result in a valid assessment owing to some lacuna which was not attributable to the assessing authorities.
