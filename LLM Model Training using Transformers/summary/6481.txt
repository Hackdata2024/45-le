The respondents, who were working as Constables in Delhi Police and whose services were terminated for participating in an agitation, filed writ petitions before the High Court, praying for quashing the order of termination, and for reinstatement, deeming them to have been in service through out, and awarding consequential benefits.
Relying on the decision of the High Court, as affirmed by the Supreme Court, in the case of some Constables, whose services were similarly terminated, the Central Administrative Tribunal, to whom the cases were transferred, held that the respond ents were entitled to be deemed to have been in service.
Dismissing the appeals, by the Administration, this Court, HELD: All the respondents should be deemed to be in service.
All of them, except respondent No. 24 who has expired and whose widow has already been paid back wages, should file affidavits, stating whether they had been gain fully employed or not during the period of the termination of service and if so employed, they will state further in the affidavits the period of such employment.
The appellants may verify the same and will be at liberty to deduct the pay and allowances during the period of such gainful employment while determining the arrears of salary and allowances for the period of termination.
However, for the purposes of seniority, promotion and retiral benefits, the entire period between termination and reinstatement shall be taken into account.
