The petitioners who were dealers in betel leaves were asses sed to sales tax by the Assistant Sales Tax Officer under the provisions of the C. P. and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947.
The contention of the petitioners was that under section 6 read with the second schedule of the Act betel leaves were not taxable.
Under section 6 of the Act articles mentioned in the said Schedule were exempt from Sales Tax and articles not mentioned were taxable.
There were two items in the Schedule, namely, item 6, "vegetables", and item 36, "betel leaves", but subsequently item No. 36 was omitted by an amendment of the Act.
Held, that the use of two distinct and different items i.e., "vegetables" and "betel leaves" and the subsequent removal of betel leaves from the Schedule were indicative of the Legislature 's intention of not exempting betel leaves from taxation.
The word "vegetable" must be interpreted not in a technical sense but in its popular sense as understood in common language i.e., denoting a class of vegetables which are grown in a kitchen garden or on a farm and are used for the table.
