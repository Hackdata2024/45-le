The Regional Transport Authority granted to the respondent a permit to operate a bus on a route.
The grant was set aside by the State Transport Appellate Tribunal on appeal filed by another applicant.
The order of the S.T.A. was quashed by a Single Judge of the High Court in a writ petition filed by the grantee from the R.T.A.
When the matter went before the Letters Patent Bench it was observed that since only the grantee from the R.T.A. had a valid permit it was not possible to grant any permit to the appellant before the S.T.A. pending the disposal of the Letters Patent Appeal as only one operator could be allowed on the route.
In the petition for special leave to appeal to this Court under article 136 against the interlocutory order, on the question of the jurisdiction of the High Court to recognise the grantee from the R.T.A. when his permit was cancelled by the S.T.A., HELD: This Court would not go into the matter at this stage because the appeal itself was pending before the High Court and all that the Bench had done was to give effect to the order of the Single Judge pending disposal of the appeal.
