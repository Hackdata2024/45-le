The petitioner, group 'A ' scientist belonging to the non medical wing of the Directorate General of Health Serv ices, filed a wit petition in this Court seeking parity in pay scales and allowances with his counter part in the medical wing.
It was contended that group 'A ' scientists are treated discriminately vis a vis their counter parts in other Ministries, because the former are not given any promotional benefits while the latter are provided with avenues for promotion.
Allowing the writ petition, this Court, HELD: 1.
Provision for promotion increases efficiency of the public service while stagnation reduces efficiency and makes the service ineffective.
Promotion is thus a normal incidence of service.
There is no justification why while similarly placed officers in other Ministries would have the benefit of promotion, the non medical 'A ' group scientists in the establishment of Directorate General of Health Serv ices would be deprived of such advantage.
[181B] 2.
In a welfare State, it is necessary that there should be an efficient public service and, therefore, it should have been the obligation of the Ministry of Health to pro vide promotional avenue for this category of officers, [181 C] 3.
On the model of rules framed by the Ministry of Science and Technology, appropriate rules should be framed providing promotional avenue for the 'A ' category scientists in the non medical wing of the Directorate.
[181D] 178 4. 'A ' Group scientists shall be entitled to book allow ance, higher degree allowance, risk allowance and conveyance allowance at the same rate as is admissible to doctors in the Medical wing in the Directorate.
[18IF] 5.
Government shall examine the tenability of the claim of Group 'A ' scientists for equal pay scales with their counterparts in medical wing.
