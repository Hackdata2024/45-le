There is no warrant for the extreme proposition that if a man sees the perpetration of a crime and does not give information of it to anyone else, he might well be regarded in law as an accomplice and that he could be put in the dock with the actual criminals.
A person may be present, and, if not aiding and abetting, be neither principal nor accessory; as, if A, happens to be present at a murder and takes no part in it, nor endeavours to prevent it, or to apprehend the murderer, this course of conduct will not of itself render him either principal or accessory.
Russell on Crime, 10th Edition, p. 1846, referred to.
33 248 In the matter of corroboration of the evidence of a single witness against the accused what the law requires is that there should be such corroboration of the material part of the story connecting the accused with the crime as will satisfy reasonable minds that the man can be regarded as a truthful witness.
The corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime.
The nature of the corroboration will depend on and vary according to the particular circumstances of each case.
Rex vs Baskerville (1916) 2 K.B.D. 658, referred to.
