The respondent, a stenotypist and the Vice President of the Labour Union, was charged by the appellant with misconduct and indiscipline under clause L(1)(j) of the Standing Orders of the Government of Uttar Pradesh for instigating the workmen to pass a resolution for the removal of the General Manager by a defamatory speech delivered at a meeting of the Union.
The question in issue was whether the respondent by doing so had committed "any act subversive of discipline" within the meaning of that clause.
In course of the correspondence with the General Manager over the matter, as also during the enquiry made by him, the respondent took up the attitude that he, as a stenotypist, was not answerable to his employers for his activities as Vice President of the Union outside the factory area and persistently refused to answer questions categorically put to him by the General Manager.
The appellant applied to the Labour Appellate Tribunal under section 22 of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act of 1960 for permission to dismiss the respondent.
That application having been refused the appellant obtained Special Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court and it was contended that the passing of the resolution and the refusal to answer questions in course of the correspondence,and the enquiry amounted to acts subversive of discipline and the respondent was liable to be dismissed.
Hold, that it was perfectly legitimate for the Union to pass the, resolution they did and no guilt either of a breach of the Standing Orders or of committing an act subversive of discipline could attach to the respondent for what part he took in the meeting as Vice President of the Union and the order of dismissal passed by the Labour Appellate Tribunal must be affirmed.
That where, as in the present case, the members of the Union were of opinion that the circumstances warranted the resolution, it 747 was not for the court to scrutinies the correctness or otherwise the reasons for it.
Held further, that the respondent was primarily an employ of the appellant before he could be anything else and was in dut bound to answer such queries as were put to him by the Gener Manager and his persistent refusal to do so, on the pretext of a dual capacity, amounted to insubordination which would have justifie his dismissal but the appellant having omitted to include this as ground in the charge sheet, which was served on the responds and formed the basis of the enquiry, could not be allowed to rel on it.
