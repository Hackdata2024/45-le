An application for leave to appeal to the High Court under section 417(3) Code of Criminal Procedure against an order of acquittal by a Magistrate dated August 31, 1965 was filed on November 1, 1965.
It was claimed that two days were necessary for obtaining the certified copy of the order of the Magistrate.
The application would be in time if these two days were deducted.
The High Court accepted the appeal and convicted the appellant.
In appeal to this Court against his conviction the appellant contended that the period of 60 days mentioned in section 417(4) was not a period of limitation within the meaning of section 12 of the Limitation Act and that the sub section barred the jurisdiction of the High Court to deal with the application if a period of 60 days had expired from the date of the order of acquittal.
HELD : The application under section 417(3) to the High Court was within time.
Section 417(4) itself prescribes a period of limitation; it was open to the legislature to prescribe a period of limitation in the code itself.
In the context of section 417(4) the word "entertain" means "file or receive by the court" and it has no reference to the actual hearing of the application for leave to appeal; otherwise the result would be that in many cases applications for leave to appeal would be barred because the applications have not been put up for hearing before the High Court within sixty days of the order of acquittal.
