The petitioners registered firm has its head office in Calcutta where its books of account are kept and maintained and where it has its banking account, the members of the firm being citizens of India.
Since its inception the firm has all along been assessed to income tax by the Income Tax Officer, District III, Calcutta.
The assessments for the years 1948 49 and 1949 50 were made by the Income Tax Officer, District III, Calcutta.
Notices under section 22(2) of the Income Tax Act were issued to the petitioner by the Income Tax Officer, District III, Calcutta to submit returns for the years 1950 51, 1951 52, 1952 53, 1953 54 and 1954 55.
The Income Tax Officer, District III, Calcutta made assessment for the year 1950 51 on 18 12 1954 being satisfied that the principal place of business of the petitioner was in Calcutta.
On the 25th January 1955 the petitioner received a letter from the Income Tax Officer, District III, Calcutta that in pursuance to orders dated 13th December 1954 under section 5(7 A) of the Income Tax Act its assessment records were transferred from that office to the Income Tax Officer, Special Circle, Ranchi with whom the petitioner was to correspond in future regarding its assessment proceedings.
The order stated that the Central Board of Revenue "hereby transfers the case of" the petitioner.
The petitioner had no previous notice of the intention of the Income Tax authorities to transfer the assessment proceedings from Calcutta to Ranchi nor bad it an opportunity to make any representation against such decision. 'When called upon to submit its return for the assessment year 1955 56 the petitioner by an application under article 32 of the Constitution contended that sub section (7 A) of section 5 of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 and the order of transfer made thereunder were unconstitutional in that they infringed the fundamental rights guaranteed to the petitioner under articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 31 of the Constitution.
section 64 of the Indian Income Tax Act makes provisions for determining the place of assessment.
Sub section (1) of that section provides 268 that where an assessee carried on a business, profession or vocation at any place he shall be assessed by the Income Tax Officer of that area in which that place is situate or where the business, profession, or vocation is carried on at more than one place by the Income Tax Officer of the area in which the principal place of business, profession or vocation is situate.
In all other cases, according to sub section (2), an assessee shall be assessed by the Income Tax Officer of the area in which he resides.
If any question arises as to the place of assessment such question shall be decided, after giving the assessee an opportunity to represent his views by the Commissioner or Commissioners concerned or in case of disagreement between them by the Board of Revenue.
The section is imperative in terms and gives a valuable right to the assessee.
By amending the Indian Income Tax Act 1922 by the Indian Income Tax (Amendment) Act, 1940 (Act XL of 1940) by adding to clause (b) of sub section (5) of section 64 the words "in consequence of any transfer made under sub section (7 A) of section 5" and by adding subsection (7 A) to section 5 the benefit conferred by the provisions of subsection (1) and sub section (2) of section 64 is taken away and is to be deemed not to have existed at any time as regards the assessee with regard to whom a transfer is made under sub section (7 A) of section 5.
Held that as under section 22(2) of the Act, the notice and the return are to be confined to a particular assessment years sub section (7 A) of section 5 contemplates the transfer of such a "case" i.e. the assessment case for a particular year.
The provision that such a transfer may be made "at any stage of the proceedings" obviously postulates proceedings actually pending and "stage ' I refers to a point in between the commencement and ending of those proceedings.
Further the transfer contemplated by the sub section is the transfer of a particular case actually pending before an Income Tax Officer of one place to the Income Tax Officer of another place.
Accordingly such an omnibus wholesale order of transfer dated 13th December 1954 as was made in the present case is not contemplated by the sub section and therefore the impugned order of transfer which was expressed in general terms without any reference to any particular case and without any limitation as to time was beyond the competence of the Central Board of Revenue and the petitioner was still entitled to the benefit of the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of section 64.
The impugned order is discriminatory against the petitioner and violates the fundamental right guaranteed to it by article 14 of the Constitution in as much as the income tax authorities by an executive order unsupported by law picked out the present petitioner and transferred all his cases by an omnibus order unlimited in point of time,which order is calculated to inflict considerable inconvenience and harassment on the petitioner.
BOSE J. Section 5(7 A) of the Indian Income Tax Act is ultra vires article 14 of the Constitution and so is section 64(5)(b) in so far as it 269 makes an order under section 5(7 A) as it now exists, inviolate.
The power of transfer can only be conferred if it is hedged round with reasonable restrictions, the absence or existence of which can in the last instance be determined by the courts; and the exercise of the power must be in conformity with the rules of natural justice, that is to say, the parties affected must be heard when that is reasonably possible, and the reasons for the order must be reduced however briefly, to writing so that men may know that the powers conferred on these quasi judicial bodies are being justly and properly exercised.
