A made a will giving life interest in his properties to three daughters in law '.
After the death of the three ladies, half share of the property was to go to two daughters of one of the daughters in law and the other half to one S, collaterally related to A. S was appointed as one of the executors of the will.
One of the terms of the will was "that on the death of me, executant the aforesaid executors should perform the Shradh ceremonies of the executant according to the means and customs in the family." S performed the cremation ceremonies and helped the two daughters in law to manage properties.
There was no evidence to show that he performed the Shradh as well.
S died before the will was duly proved.
The principal question in the suit filed by the heirs of S was whether there was adequate manifestation of an intention to act as an executor on the part of section The two lower Courts held that the intention to act as an executor was apparent from the facts while the High Court held that, since there was no evidence of Shradh being performed by there was no 'manifestation ', as required by Sec.
141 of the Indian Succession Act.
Dismissing the appeal, HELD : There is a distinction between the cremation ceremonies and shradh ceremonies which are periodic.
It is also evident that what the testator desired his executors to do was that they should perform his shradh ceremonies.
The manner in which the testator has referred to S in his will, almost as a substitute for a son, shows that he expected S to perform his shradh ceremonies as his own sons, who had predeceased him, would have preformed these.
There is no evidence whatsoever on record that S ever performed any such ceremony.
The conclusion reached by the High Court, therefore, is correct.
