Mining Local Board functioning in the area in which the petitioners were working certain mines situated therein, and having vested in it all the powers of a district council, resolved to impose a tax on coal, coal dust and coke manufactured at the mines or sold within the territorial jurisdiction of the Board.
The petitioners who were served with notices of demand requiring them to pay certain sums of money as the tax due by them for despatches of coal from their mines, challenged the legality of the levy of the tax on the grounds, inter alia (1) that the Act which by section 51 authorised the imposition of the tax, had been passed by the local legislature without the previous sanction of the Governor General, thereby contravening section 80A(3) of the Government of India Act, 1915, and that even if it was found that the Act was validly passed before the coming into force of the Government of India Act, 1919, which introduced section 80A into the Act of r 1915, the power conferred by section 51 to levy tax was exercised only in 1935 and by that date S.80 A had been introduced into the Government of India Act,1915, and that thereafter there could be no legal imposition of a tax without the previous sanction of the Governor General being obtained, (2) that section 51 Of the Central Provinces Local Self Government Act, 1920, on its language and in the context of other provisions referred to in that section, did not authorise .the levy of a tax of the nature of the coal tax, and (3) that, in any case, the tax ceased to be legally leviable after the coming 2 into force of the Government of India Act, 1935, and of the Constitution of India, since a tax like that in question could be in posed only by the Central Government.

(2) that the validity of Central Provinces Local Self Government Act, 1920, when enacted, not being open to any objection under the Government of India Act, 1915, any subsequent amendments to the latter Act could not in any manner affect its continued validity and operation.
(3) that on the proper construction Of section 51 of the Act of 1920, the levy of a coal tax is not excluded from the purview of the local authority.
(4) that the continued levy of the tax in question even after the coming into force of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the Constitution of India, is valid in view of section 143 Of the Act of 1935 and article 227 of the Constitution.
