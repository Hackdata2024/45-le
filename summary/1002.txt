The appellants held personal inams which were governed by Bombay Acts Nos.
II and VII of 1863 by virtue of which they held their lands on payment of land revenue which was less than the full assessment.
After.
coming into force of the Bombay Personal Inams Abolition Act, 1952, the appellants who were affected by it Challenged the validity of the Act on the grounds, inter alia, (i) that the property which had been dealt with under the Act was not an estate inasmuch as what sections 4 and 5 extinguished was the right of the inamdar to appropriate to himself the difference between the full assessment and 944 the quit rent and this was not an estate within the meaning of article 31 A of the Constitution of India, and (2) that no compensation bad been provided in the Act for taking away the property of the appellants.
Held: (i) that the right of the inamdar to appropriate to himself the difference between the full assessment and the quit rent was a right in respect of land revenue and was therefore a right in an estate by virtue of the definition in article 31 A(2)(b).
Such a right also fell under section 3(5) Of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879, and as such it was an estate under article 31 A.
Accordingly, the Act when it extinguished or modified the rights of inamdars in inam estates was protected by article 31 A. (2) that sub section
(5) Of section 17 of the Act under which no compensation was to be paid for the loss to the inamdar of what he used to get because of the difference between the quit rent and the full assessment, was not invalid as article 31 A saved the Act from any attack under article 31 which was the only Article providing for compensation.
