N borrowed rupees one lakh from D on mortgage of a house and Zamindari interest on March 1, 1924.
Interest was 8% per annum compoundable with six monthly rests.
In 1932 the mortgagee filed a suit on the mortgage and a decree was passed for the recovery of Rs. 1,83,781/5/9 principal and interest upto the date of the suit and Rs. 49,280/ 2/6 interest from date of the suit upto the date fixed for payment, with future interest at 6% per annum simple on the principal sum.
On the failure of the mortgagor to pay by the date fixed a final decree was passed on May 9, 1935 for sale of the property for recovery of a sum of Rs. 2,37,503/5/6 which had become due.
On October 26, 1936, N made an application under section 4 of the U. P. Encumbered Estates Act, 1934, requesting that the provisions of the Act be applied to him.
Section 14(4)(a) of the Act provided that " the amount of interest held to be due on the date of application shall not exceed that portion of the principal which may still be found to be due on the date of the application ".
N contended that in view of section 14(4)(a), D was not entitled to recover any sum as interest in excess of the principal sum of rupees one lakh.
D contended that it was not necessary to reopen the decree as the principle of section 14(4)(a) had not been violated in passing the decree.
Held, that the proper decree that should have been passed on the application was for rupees two lakhs for the principal and interest plus costs and interest pendente lite and future interest at 4% per annum.
The words " on the date of the application " in section 14(4)(a) of the Act had been deliberately used to benefit the applicant by reducing the interest to the amount of the principal found still due on the date of the application, whatever amount of interest may be due under the contract.
The fact that there had been a decree did not make any difference in giving the benefit of the section to the applicant.
