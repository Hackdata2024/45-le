The Company Law Board by its order dt.
17th December, 1977 inducted several additional directors in addition to the existing directors of the respondent company, under section 408(1) of the , since it was of the opinion that the affairs of the company in question "are being conducted in a manner which is prejudicial to the interest of the company and to public interest".
But the Delhi High Court passed an ad interim stay of the said orders, while admitting the writ Petition.
Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court ^ HELD: Where repercussions are incalculable and the basis of the direction, though interlocutory, is obscure, the ends of justice dominate and the Supreme Court may interfere, if public interest so dictates under article 136 of the Constitution.
[736B] (2) A company of considerable financial dimensions and involved in operations using public resources as investment naturally becomes the concern not merely of the Company Law Board but also all of the economic process of the country.
The specialised body with responsibility to watchdog corporate process is the Company Law Board.
When it investigates and reaches a definite conclusion and makes a consequential direction, it is entitled to prima facie respect unless there are glaring circumstances to the contrary.
It may well be that the order of the Board may be vitiated by infirmities, legal or other.
It may also be that the reasoning of the Board and the factual foundation for it is sound.
In such situations acting at an interlocutory stage, the benefit of reasonable doubt belongs to the specialised body.
If there are good grounds to strike down the order certainly the High Court has jurisdiction to stay its operation.
