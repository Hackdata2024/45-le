Clause (a) of Rule 7 of the Himachal Pradesh Nautor Land Rules, 1968 makes every resident of the estate having less than ten bighas of land or having an income of less than Rs.2,000 per annum from all sources including lands, eligi ble for grant of land in nautor.
The grant of nautor land to the appellant teacher was set aside by the Financial Commissioner in revision.
The High Court dismissed the writ petition in limine.
In the appeal by special leave it was contended for the appellant that the word 'or ' occurring in between the first and the second part of cl.
(a) of Rule 7 has to be given its ordinary meaning and it cannot be read as 'and ' that the two parts of the clause were, therefore, independent of each other and had to be read disjunctively, and that he being eligible under the first part, even though having an income of more than Rs.2,000 per annum as a teacher, the second part of cl.
(a) was not attracted.
Dismissing the appeal, the Court, HELD: 1.
A person who has got less than 10 bighas of land but has an income of more than Rs.2,000 per annum from all sources including the said land is not eligible for allotment of nautor land under cl.

[800G] 2.

Considering the nature, scope and the clear intention of the framers of the Rules it is necessary to read the word 'or ' in between the first and the second part of clause (a) as 'and '.
The two parts cannot, therefore, be read disjunctive ly.
The second part makes it clear that an income of less than Rs.2,000 per annum should be from all sources including lands.
[800H; 801A] 798 3.
