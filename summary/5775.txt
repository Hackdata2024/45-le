The Kothari Commission appointed by the Government of India to examine the conditions of service of teachers with the object of improving the standards of education in the country recommended inter alia that the scales of pay of school teachers belonging to the same category but working under different managements such as Government, local bodies or private organisations should be the same, and, falling in line with other States, the State of Haryana decided to implement the same with effect from 1 December, 1967.
As the deficit between the original grades and the revised grades was found too burdensome for the managements of the aided schools to bear, the State decided to meet the increased expenditure entirely in regard to Pay and Dearness Allowance.
The State Government followed the principle of parity between the teachers working in aided schools and Government schools until 1979.
In 1979, the pay scale of teachers in Government schools was revised by the State after the report of the Pay Commission, but in the case of the teachers of aided schools the revision was effected two years later.
The appellants and the writ petitioners, who were teachers employed in various recognised aided private schools, alleged that the salary and other emoluments such as Dearness Allowance, House Rent Allowance, City Compensatory Allowance, Medical Reimbursement, Gratuity, etc., paid to them had fallen far behind the emoluments paid to the teachers in Government schools and this Court should interfere in order to remove such discrimination since the constitutional responsibility of providing education in schools devolved on the Government and it exercised deep and pervasive control over the running of aided schools.
Disposing of the appeal and petitions, ^ HELD: There is general agreement between the parties that there is no reason for discrimination between the teachers employed in aided 683 schools and those employed in Government schools far as the salaries and Additional Dearness Allowances are concerned.
The State Government has expressed its readiness to reimburse the payment of ten instalments of the Additional Dearness Allowance, but not the twenty five Additional Dearness Allowance instalments released after 1 April, 1981.
In our opinion, the teachers of aided schools must be paid the same pay scale and Dearness Allowance as teachers in Government schools for the entire period claimed by the petitioners, and that the expenditure on that account should be apportioned between the State and the Management in the same proportion in which they share the burden of the existing emoluments of the teachers.
[685B C, E G] The State Government will also take up with the managements of the aided schools the question of bringing about Party between the teachers of aided schools and the teachers of Government schools so that 9 scheme for payment may be evolved after having regard to the different allowances claimed by the petitioners.
