Section 220 of the , which corresponds to section 134 of the 1913 Act, provides that within thirty days after the balance sheet and profit and loss account, as the case may be, have been laid before the company at the general meeting.
three copies thereof shall be filed with the registrar and that failure to do so is punishable.
The respondent company and its directors were prosecuted for failure to file with the Registrar of Companies on or before 30th October 1967, the Balance sheet and profit and loss account of the company.
By 30th September, 1967, admittedly, no general body meeting had been held.
The High Court held that since no general body meeting was held, there could be no question of laying the balance sheet before the general body meeting and complying with the requirements of the section; and that, though the willful omission to call a general body meeting and of laying the balance sheet and profit and loss account before it may expose the persons responsible to punishment under other provisions of the Act, it would not make them liable either under section 134(4) of the 1913 Act or section 220 of the 1956 Act.
Dismissing the appeal to this Court, HELD : On principle and authority it should be held that no offence was committed under section 220 of the .
[417B] (a) The principle accepted by this Court in State of Bombay vs Bandhan Ram Bhandani [1961] 1 S.C.R_ 801, that a company or its directors in a prosecution under sections 32 and 133 of the 1913 Act, could not, in defence to such prosecution, rely upon their own failure to call the general body meeting would not apply to a prosecution under section 134 of the 1913 Act or section 220 of the 1956 Act.
Unlike sections 32 and 133, the responsibility of I sending to the Registrar the copies of the balance sheet and profit and loss account arises only after they have been laid before the company at the general meeting, the obligation to do so being completely dependent on its being laid before a general meeting.
[414H 415E] (b) Where the words in the section are clear it is unnecessary to consider whether it embodies any principle and whether that principle is consistent with the principle as embodied in other sections which are differently worded.
In interpreting a penal provision it is not permissible to give an extended meaning to the plain words of the section on the ground of a principle recognised in certain other provisions.
[415F G] (c) This is not a case where an accused person relies on his default and pleads his innocence.
In the , various stages have to be gone through before we reach the stage of a copy of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account being filed with the Registrar.
The failure to reach any one of the stages within the time prescribed is made penal by the Act.
The respondents may be guilty of any of those offences but not of the offence with which they were charged.
[416E G] (d) Further a daily penalty is provided after the thirtieth day mentioned in section 220 (1) of the 1956 Act.
When no general body meeting was held it is not possible to calculate the period of 30 days and there would be diffi culty in working Cut he daily penalty.
