The appellant 's election was challenged inter alia, on the ground that he belonged to the Dohar caste which was not recognised as a Scheduled Caste for the district in question and so his declaration that he belonged to the Chamar caste which was a Schedule Caste was improperly and illegally accepted by the Returning Officer.
The Election Tribunal declared the election invalid.
The finding was confirmed on appeal by the High Court.
In appeal to the Supreme Court.
HELD : (i) The plea that though the appellant is not a Chamar as such, he can claim the same status by reason of the fact that he belonged to Dohar Caste which is a sub caste of the Chamar caste cannot be accepted.
An enquiry of this kind would not be permissible having regard to the provisions contained in article 341 of the Constitution.
[881 F G] Basavalingappa vs D. Munichinnappa, ; , referred to.
(ii)In specifying castes, races or tribes under article 341 of the Constitution, the President has been expressly authorised to limit the notification to parts of or groups within the castes, race or tribe, the President may well come to the conclusion that not the whole caste, race or tribe but parts of or groups within them should be specified.
Similarly the President can specify castes, races or tribes or parts thereof in relation not only to the entire State, but in relation to the parts of the State where he is satisfied that the examination of the social and educational backwardness of the race, caste or tribe justifies such specification.
