The firm of Bhagat Ram Mohan Lal Appellant constituted on 23 8 1940 was registered under section 26 A of the Indian Income tax Act, the partners of the firm according to the registration certificate being (1) Bhagat Ram Mohan Lal (Hindu undivided family), (2) Richpal and (3) Gajadhar, their shares being respectively 8 annas, 4 annas and 4 annas.
Mohan Lal was the karta of the aforesaid family, which consisted of himself and his two brothers, Chhotelal and Bansilal.
The firm made profits during the accounting years ending 1943 and 1944 on which it was assessed to excess profits tax respectively of Rs. 10,023/5/ and Rs. 13,005/5/ .
During the year 19441945 it sustained a loss of Rs. 15,771 and adding thereto Rs. 37,800 the standard profits for the business, the Excess Profits Tax Officer determined the deficiency of profits for the year at Rs. 53,571 .
Acting under section 7 of the Excess Profits Tax Act the Excess Profits Tax Officer passed an order on 23 12 1946 whereby after setting off the profits of the firm for the years ending 1943 and 1944 against the deficiency of profits during the year ending 1945, he directed a refund of Rs. 23,028/10/ which had been paid by the appellant as excess profits tax for those years.
At the commencement of the assessment year 1944 1945 there was a partition in the joint family of which Mohan Lal was erstwhile karta, he and his two brothers becoming divided in status.
As a result thereof the appellant firm was reconstituted under an agreement dated 17 10 1944, the partners of the firm being five in number.
There was a reconstitution of the firm with respect to persons 144 and their shares.
According to section 8(1) of the Excess Profits Tax Act the change in the persons is deemed to bring about a discontinuation of the old business and the commencement of a new one and if that section applied no relief could have been granted to the appellant under section 7 of the Act.
The facts as to the reconstitution of the firm having come to the knowledge of the Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax he issued a notice under section 20 of the Excess Profits Tax Act calling upon the appellant why the order of Excess Profits Tax Officer dated 23 12 1946 should not be set aside on the ground of mistake as he had failed to take into consideration the change in the constitution of the firm which took place on 17 10 1944.
After hearing the appellant the Commissioner held by his order dated 15 3 1950 that on the facts disclosed there was a change in the persons and that the award of relief under section 7 of the Act by the Excess Profits Tax Officer was a mistake.
He set aside order only so far as Bhagat Ram Mohan Lal was concerned maintaining it with regard to two others.
On an application for a writ of certiorari and for a writ of prohibition under article 226 of the Constitution the High Court upheld the order of the Commissioner.
On an appeal by Special Leave to the Supreme Court: Held (1) that by reason of the partition of the joint family and the reconstitution of the firm under the deed dated 17 10 1944 there was a change in the persons carrying on business within section 8(1) of the Act.
If all the five persons who were mentioned as partners in the deed of 1944 were partners of the old firm, there would be no change in the persons carrying on the business within section 8(1) of the Act by the mere fact of reshuffling of the shares among them but the real question for determination was whether Chhotelal and Bansilal were partners in the firm constituted on 23 8 1940.
It is not in dispute that Mohanlal was the karta of the joint family, and that he entered into the partnership on 23 8 1940 as such karta.
It is well settled that when the karta of a joint Hindu family enters into a partnership with strangers, the members of the family do not ipso facto become partners in that firm.
They have no right to take part in its management or to sue for its dissolution.
The creditors of the firm would no doubt be entitled to proceed against the joint family assets including the shares of the non partner copareeners for realisation of their debts.
But that is because under the Hindu Law, the karta has the right when properly carrying on business to pledge the credit of the joint family to the extent of its assets, and not because the junior members become partners in the business.
The liability of the junior members arises by reason of their status as coparceners and not by reason of any contract of partnership and it would follow therefore that when Mohanlal became a partner of the firm on 23 8 1940 Chhotelal and Bansilal could not be held by reason of that fact alone to have become partners therein, 145 Accordingly whether the question was to be considered on the principles of Hindu law or on the principles of the Excess Profits Tax Act there was a change in the personnel of the firm on 17 10 1944 and the matter fell within section 8(1) of the Act.
(2) That there was a mistake apparent on the record as required by section 20 of the Act and the Commissioner had jurisdiction to pass the order dated 15 3 1950 which he did.
There was no force in the contention that the record in Excess Profits Tax proceedings consisted in the present case of the only order dated 23 12 1946 and that the facts on which the proceedings were taken under section 20, namely, the constitution of the firm on 23 8 1940 and the changes effected therein on 17 10 1944 were not recited therein and that in consequence there were no materials on which an order could have been passed under that section because though the order of the Excess Profits Tax Officer dated 23 12 1946 does not mention these facts these facts appear from the record of the income tax proceedings which included the, registration certificate of the firm under section 26 A of the Income Tax Act and the returns made by the firm disclosing the names of the partners and their respective shares.
Fur ther the fact is that the proceedings under the two Acts, namely, the Excess Profits Tax Act and the Income Tax Act, are interdependent.
