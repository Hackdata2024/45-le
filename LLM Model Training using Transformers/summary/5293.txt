The assessee was an unregistered firm carrying on busi ness of manufacture and sale of Katechu.
The firm carried on the work of extraction of Katechu in Nepal and sales were affected in Kanpur.
It had first taken a jungle on lease and Katechu were extracted from October 1940 to September, 1941.
Sales were effected from 30th May, 1941 to 29th September, 1941.
Thereafter, another jungle was taken on lease and Katechu were extracted from 23rd November, 1942 to 6th November, 1944.
The sales were effected between 26th July, 1943 to 4th April, 1944.
The assessee claimed set off of deficiency of profit for the periods 20th October, 1940 to 17th October, 1941 and 23rd November, 1942 to 31st March, 1943 on the ground that the business carried on during the chargeable accounting period 1 4 1943 to 31 3 1944 was not separate to and dis tinct from the business carried on in 1940 41.
The Excess Profit Tax Officer did not set off the defi ciency of profits that accrued in respect of the period 1940 41 out of the profits for the chargeable accounting period from 1 4 1943 to 31 3 1944, and held that the busi ness carried on during October, 1940 to October, 1941 was completely different from the business carried on during the aforesaid chargeable accounting period.
So far as the deficiency pertaining to the period Novem ber, 1942 to 31st March, 1943 was concerned, the manufactur ing operations started on or about 23rd November, 1942 and the sales started on 26th July, 1943.
Katechu produced from 23rd November, 1942 to 31st March, 1943 remained in stock till the last date of the chargeable accounting period.
namely, 31st March, 1943.
As the assessee did not, maintain any books of account, the provisions of section 13 of the Income Tax were applicable.
The Revenue, therefore, valued the stock intrade at cost and held that there could be no profit or loss during the chargeable accounting period.
In appeal, the assessee urge that deficiency in profits pertaining to the chargeable accounting periods from Octo ber, 1940 to 31st March, 1941, and 23rd November, 1942 to 31st March, 1943 should be allowed a set off in computing the excess profits and as there were no profits during the said chargeable accounting period, the standard profits became the deficiency of the said two years which should have been allowed set off and that as manufacturing opera tions were carried on during the said periods, it could not be said that the assessee did not carry on any business.
The Appellate Assistant Commissioner found that the constitution of the firm during the chargeable accounting period was the same as in 1940 41, that the accounts were maintained in the same fashion and the same business was carried on, that the assessee had effected sales only during 30th May, 1941 to 29th September, 1941 and held that the assessee was entitled to set off in respect of the deficien cy of profits.
He, therefore, confirmed that there were no profits and losses during the chargeable accounting period ending on 31st March, 1941 and as such there could be no deficiency of profits.
The assessee was, therefore, held to be entitled to a set off of the deficiency only for the chargeable accounting period ending on 31st March, 1942 which consisted of the period 1st April.
1941 to 29th Sep tember.
The Tribunal, however, held that no profits accrued unless sale was effected and accepting the contention of the Revenue that no part of profits, which accrued during the said two chargeable accounting periods could be charged and were in fact not so charged to income tax, as no sales were effected, the Act itself did not apply and confirmed the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
The High Court divided the entire period of manufacture and sales to determine the question whether there was manu facturing activity and sale; (1) October 28, 1940 to March 31, 1941, failing in the financial year ending March 31, 1941, Katechu was manufactured but there was no sale; (2) April 1, 1941 to September 29, 1941, failing in the finan cial year ending March 31, 1942; sales took place from May 30, 1941 to September 29, 1941; (3) November 23, 1942 to March 31, 1943 failing in the financial year ending March 31, 1943; Katechu was manufactured but there was no sale; (4) April 1, 1943 to March 31, 603 1944, failing in the financial year ending March 31,.
1944; sale took place from July 26, 1943 to March 31, 1944; (5) April 1, 1944 to April 4, 1944, failing in the financial year ending March 31, 1945; sales were effected from April 1, 1944 to April 4, 1944 when the business was discontinued.
It held that while there was manufacturing activity there was no sale during the financial years ending March 31, 1941 to March 31, 1943, that the profits earned upon sales ef fected during the chargeable accounting period ending 31st March, 1944 must be apportioned between the manufacturing activity during the chargeable accounting period ending 31st March, 1943 and the sales during the chargeable accounting period ending 31st March, 1944 and that the deficiency of profits must be set off in computing the excess profits for the chargeable accounting period ending 31st March, 1944.
The High Court, therefore, did not accept the opinion of the Tribunal and held that the assessee was entitled to a set off of deficiency of profits relating to the periods 28 10 1940 to 31 3 1941 and 23 11 1942 to 31 3 1943 from the profits of the chargeable accounting period 1 4 1943 to 31 3 1944.
Allowing the Appeal, HELD: 1.
The scheme contained in the Excess Profits Tax Act is a legislation intended to tax the profits of certain business in excess of a certain limit as provided in that Act.
It is, therefore, complementary to the Income Tax Act by its very nature.
[610D] Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay vs Raipur Manufactur ing Co., Ltd., at 733, followed.
In order to work out the scheme of the Act, there must be proper dovetailing of the concept of 'accounting period '. 'chargeable accounting period ' and basic scheme of the Income Tax Act bearing in mind that excess profits are excess of profits which were intended to be mopped up during the war period, to be taxed separately and differently.
[612H; 613A B] 3.
If the right to receive those profits had accrued or arisen subsequently then even though they had accrued or arisen by reason of work done during the chargeable account ing period, these were not liable to be treated as the profits of that chargeable accounting period.
[613C] 4.Whether the profits in the one case could be identi fied with the profits in the other would be determined by reference to the period in which those accrued or arose.
The profits during the chargeable 604 accounting period must be computed under the Excess Profits Tax on the same basis as are profits for an income tax assessment.
[613D E] Haji Rahmat Ullah and Co. vs Commissioner of Income tax, U.P., , relied upon.
It has to be clearly borne in mind that the Act is not an entirely different Act in the sense that it proceeds upon the concept completely different from the notions of Income Tax and has its source in an entirely different tax concept.
More profits which were likely to have been earned due to profits, these were made subject to excess profits.
[613E F] 6.
Though profit in a composite transaction could be apportioned as between manufacture and sale in the same accounting year, such an apportionment is not permissible when one part of the transaction, i.e. manufacture, falls in one chargeable accounting period and falls in another part of the accounting period i.e. the trading operations i.e. falls in another accounting period, then set off deficiency in profits under section 7 of the Act is permitted but a necessary precondition was that profit must be made in the accounting period to which the deficiency relates.
[613G H; 614A] 7.
The excess profit under the Act is profit determined under the Income Tax Act subject to prescribed adjustments.
If the income tax assessment discloses nil profits, no separate profit can be determined independently under the Act.
[614A B] 8.
It is a general principle, in the computation of the manual profits of a trade or business under the Income Tax Acts, that those elements of profits or gain, and those only, enter into the computation which are earned or ascer tained in the year to which the enquiry refers; and in like manner, only those elements of loss or expense enter into the computation which are suffered or incurred during that year.
