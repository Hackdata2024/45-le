The appellant filed a suit for evicting his tenant Bhagwandas Kanu etc.
after giving them a notice to quit.
The Trial Court dismissed the suit but on appeal, the First Appellate Court passed a decree for eviction against the respondents.
In second appeal before the High Court, the respondents assailed the validity of the notice to quit, on the ground that it did not conform with the requirements of section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act.
The High Court allowed the appeal holding that the notice to quit did not clearly terminate the tenancy on the expiration of the, month of the tenancy, and was invalid.
Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court, HELD: A notice to quit must be construed ut res magis valeat quam pereat.
It must not be read in a hyper critical manner, nor must its interpretation be affected by pedagogic pendantism or over refined subtlety, but it should be construed in a common sense, way.
The notice to qui re quired the respondents to vacate "within the month of Octo ber 1962", otherwise they would be treated as trespassers from 1st November, 1962.
This makes the intention of the authors of the notice clear that they were terminating the tenancy only with effect from the end of the month of October 1962 and not with effect from any earlier point of time during the currency of that month.
