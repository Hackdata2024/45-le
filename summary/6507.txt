To a question whether lamination of duty paid kraft paper with polyethylene resulting in 'polyethylene laminated paper ' would amount to 'manufacture ' and excisable under Excise Law, the Collector of Central Excise (Appeals) an swered in the negative, and held that the appellant was eligible to claim refund of duty paid by it.
In reaching this finding he followed the decision in Standard Packag ings, Nellore vs Union of India, AP.
Against the said order, the Collector of Central Excise preferred an appeal before the Customs, Central Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal.
The Tribunal reversed the order of the Collector (Appeals) and held that the appellant was liable to duty.
Aggrieved, the appellant has preferred this appeal under Section 35 L(b) of the .
It was contended that duty was already paid on kraft paper and there was no change in the essential characteristic or the user of the paper after lamination, and that both the goods belong to the same entry.
Dismissing the appeal, HELD: 1.1.
By process of lamination of kraft paper with polyethylene different goods come into being.
Laminated kraft paper is distinct, separate and different from the kraft paper.
Lamination, indisputably by the well settled principles of excise law, amounts to manufacture.
[632C D] 631 1.2. 'Manufacture ' is bringing into being goods as known in the excise laws, that is to say, known in the market having distinct, separate and identifiable function.
[632F] 1.3.
Even if the goods belong to the same entry, the goods are different identifiable goods, known as such in the market.
If that is so, manufacture occurs, and if manufac ture takes place, it is dutiable.
