The assessee is a Hindu undivided family and the assessment years are 1955 56 and 1957 58 to 1961 62.
The assessee addressed on October 10, 1960 to the Income tax Officer in connection with a notice received under section 18A(1) of the Act in respect of the assessment year 1961 62 stating that all the movable and immovable properties of the assessee had been partitioned by metes and bounds under partition deeds and that the Hindu undivided family was no longer receiving any income as such and there was therefore no question of payment of any advance tax by it.
A specific request to record the factum of the partition for that purpose of the Act effective from July 10, 1960 was also prayed for.
This was followed by another letter on June 16, 1961 by M/s. S.G. Dastagir and Co.
On behalf of the assessee in connection with advance tax demanded for the assessment year 1962 63 with a similar request.
Before fresh assessments were completed for the years 1955 56, 1957 58 and 1958 59 as per the orders of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner dated February 24, 1962 a third letter dated March 11, 1962 was addressed to the same Income tax Officer with a similar request for recording the factum of partition.
Another letter dated March 21, 1962 was addressed by M/s. S.G. Dastagir & Co. reminding the Income tax Officer of the earlier letters of October 10, 1960 and June 16, 1961.
The assessment for the years 1955 56 to 1958 59 were, however, completed between August 21, 1962 and March 27, 1963 without holding any inquiry as contemplated by section 25A of the 1922 Act regarding the factum of partition.
The Income tax Officer thereafter started an inquiry under section 25A and by his order dated March 30, 1965 refused to record the partition.
On appeal against the refusal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner by his order dated November 8, 1967 set aside the said order and directed the Income tax Officer to record the partition under section 25A as on July 10, 1960.
That order became final as an appeal was filed against it by the Revenue.
In the appeals filed before the Assistant Appellate Commissioner against the assessment orders for the years in question, that is, 1955 56 and 1957 58 to 1961 62 the assessee con 506 tended that the assessments were liable to be set aside on the ground that the inquiry into the claim of partition which was a condition precedent for making an order of assessment on the Hindu undivided family had not been made as required by section 25A of the Act.
The Appellate Assistant Commissioner rejected the said contention, but the appeals preferred before the Tribunal were allowed.
The Tribunal cancelled the assessments without any directions to make fresh assessments.
At the instance of the Revenue a reference was made by the Tribunal to the High Court of Andhra Pradesh under section 66(1) of the Act.
The High Court answered the reference in favour of the Revenue and hence the appeals.
Allowing the appeals, the Court ^ HELD: (1) Under section 25A of the 1922 Act the Income tax Officer was bound to hold an inquiry into the claim of partition if it is made by or on behalf of any member of the Hindu undivided family which is being assessed hitherto as such and record a finding thereon.
If no such finding is recorded sub section (3) of section 25A of the Act becomes clearly attracted.
When a claim is made in time and the assessment is made on the Hindu undivided family without holding an inquiry as contemplated by section 25A(1), the assessment is liable to be set aside in appeal as it is in clear violation of the procedure prescribed for that purpose, [517 A C] Kalwa Devadattam and two Ors.
vs The Union of India and Ors., ; ; Additional Income tax Officer, Cuddapah vs A. Thimmayya & Anr., and Karri Ramkrishna Reddy vs Tax Recovery Officer, Vijayawada, , discussed and distinguished.
(2) The duty of the Tribunal does not end with making declaration that the assessments are illegal and it is duty bound to issue further directions.
The appellate authority has the jurisdiction as well as the duty to correct all errors in the proceedings under appeal and to issue, if necessary, appropriate directions to the authority against whose decision the appeal is preferred to dispose of the whole or any part of the matter afresh unless forbidden from doing so by the statute.
The statute does not say that such a direction cannot be issued by the appellate authority in a case of this nature.
[517 D E] In the instant case, however, since it is not established that the claim was a belated one the proper order to be passed is to set aside the assessments and to direct the Income tax Officer to make fresh assessments in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law.
The Tribunal, therefore, erred in merely cancelling the assessment orders and in not issuing further directions.
