By clause 4 of a will the testator bequeathed to his grand daughters T and S an absolute right in the properties that were to devolve on them after the death of his wife.
, Clause 5 further provided that if one of the two grand daughters were to die issueless the other living grand daughter was to enter into possession of the entire property as absolute owner.
After the death of the testator 's wife T and S divided the properties which devolved on them in equal shares.
On S dying issueless T instituted a suit for possession of the properties that fell to the share of S basing her claim on clause 5 of the will.
The suit was dismissed.
Dismissing the appeal, HELD : Clause 5 of the will relates to devolution, it does not provide for any divestment of an estate which had vested.
The estate that vested in S under clause 4 of the will was not a conditional estate, it was an absolute one.
The will does not provide for the divestment of that estate.
Clause 5 would have come into operation if the contingency mentioned therein had happened before the properties absolutely devolved on T and section What the testator intended was that if any of his grand daughters died issueless before the devolution took place then the entire property should go to another grand daughter.
The intention of the testator is plain from the language of the will.
[73 E] Section 124 of the applies to the facts of the case and not section 131.
The legacy claimed by the appellant is unavailable as the contemplated contingency did not occur before the fund bequeathed was payable or distributable.
Section 131 provides for the divestment of an estate which had already vested; it speaks of an estate going over to another person.
