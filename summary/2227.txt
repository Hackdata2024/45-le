In July 1925 it was notified under section 120(2) of the U. P. District Boards Act, 1922 that the District Board of Moradabad in exercise of powers conferred by section 108(2) of the Act had imposed a tax with effect from September 1, 1925, on the residents of the District according to their circumstances and property at the rate of 4 pice per rupee on the total taxable income subject to a maximum of Rs. 200.
In May 1927 the District Board passed a resolution increasing the maximum from Rs. 200 to Rs. 500 and thereafter the State Government issued a notification in January 1928, amending the rules for the assessment and collection of tax so as to increase the maximum to Rs. 500.
In August 1931, the Board passed another resolution in creasing the maximum further to Rs. 2,000 and the State Government issued a notification in March 1932 further amending the rules so as to incorporate the new maximum.
No further action was taken by the District Board to enforce these amendments of the rules.
Upon a writ filed by the respondents under Act, 226 of the Constitution, the High Court directed the District Board, Moradabad, not to levy upon the respondent a tax in excess of Rs. 200 per year on the ground that no special resolution of the Board had been passed nor a notification issued by the State under sections 119 and 120 respectively of the Act imposing the tax with revised maximum limits.
In appeal to the Supreme Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that when the procedure laid down in sections 1.15 to 118 had been followed whereby the amendments had been approved by resolutions and notified, it was not necessary that there should be a further resolution and notification under section 119 and section 120 respectively.
Held: The tax with the revised maximum limits introduced in 1928 and 1932 could not be imposed without a resolution under section 119 and a notification under section 120.
[5B] The object of sections 119 and 120 is to fix the date from which the tax can be imposed.
If no date is fixed, no tax can be imposed.
Once the Board passes a special resolution under, section 119, it has to go to the Government under section 120, and then the Government notifies the imposition of tax from the appointed date.
It is then that the notification becomes conclusive Proof of the fact that the tax has been imposed in accordance with the provisions of this Act Sub clause (3) of section 120 clearly proceeds on the basis that the imposition of tax takes place on a notification issued under section 120 and not on the issue of a notification under section 118.
