The appellant was appointed on probation as the Principal of the Model Inter College, Thora on August, 28, 1967.
His period of probation was extended by one year and thereafter by a letter dated June 30, 1969 addressed to him with a copy of a resolution dated 27th April, 1969 passed by the Managing Committee wherein various allegations were made regarding his conduct, his services were terminated by the respondent.
Aggrieved by the said orders of termination of his services, the appellant filed a writ petition No. 4823 of 1970 on the file of the High Court of Allahabad.
The said writ petition was allowed on January 23, 1973 and the order of termination was quashed.
However, the special Appeal No. 31 of 1973 filed by Respondent was accepted and allowed by the Division Bench.
Hence the appeal by special leave of the Court.
Allowing the appeal, the Court, ^ HELD: 1.
Section 16 of the Uttar Pradesh Intermediate Education Act, (Act II of 1921) provides that every person employed in a recognised institution shall be governed by such conditions of service as may be prescribed by Regulations and that the Regulations inter alia may be made in respect of the period of probation, the conditions of confirmation and the procedure for the imposition of punishment Regulations 35 to 38 relate to the procedure to be followed before imposing the punishment of dismissal or removal from service and they being virtually the same as provided by Article 311(2) of the Constitution, the principles which should govern this instant case should therefore be the same as those underlying Article 311(2).
Admittedly here no enquiry was held as provided for in Regulation 35 and 36.
Therefore the non compliance with the 753 provisions of Section 16 of the Act and Regulations 35 to 38 vitiates the termination order.
[747F G; 759G; 760E] Parshotam Lal Dhingra vs Union of India [1958] S.C.R. 828; Shamsher Singh and Anr vs State of Punjab. ; ; Anoop Jaiswal vs Government of India and Anr. ; ; referred to.
If the order of termination carried a stigma it has to fall to the ground unless it is preceded by an enquiry as contemplated by law.
A reading of the letter of termination of the service and the resolution which forms part of that letter clearly shows that they bear a mark of disgrace and infamy and the appellant is visited with evil consequences.
The order of the Division Bench is therefore unsustainable.
[762D E].
[The Court declared that the appellant continues to be in the service of the College with entitlement to all consequential benefits including the salary and allowances as if there was no break in his service.] [762G]
