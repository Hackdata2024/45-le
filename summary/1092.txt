The respondents dealt in gunnies.
They first entered into contracts with two Mills agreeing to purchase gunnies at a certain rate for future delivery, and also entered into agreement with third parties, by which they charged something extra from those third parties and handed over the delivery order known as kutcha delivery order.
The Mills however did not accept the third parties as contracting parties, but only as the agents of the appellants and delivered the goods against the kutcha delivery orders, and collected the Sales Tax from the third parties.
The tax authorities treated these transactions between the appellant and the third parties as fresh sales and sought to levy sales tax again, which the appellants contended, was not demandable as there were no second sales; the delivery of a kutcha delivery order did not amount to a sale of goods, but was only an assignment of a right to obtain delivery of gunnies which were not in existence and not appropriated to the contract; this was only an assignment of a forward contract.
Held, that the agreements between the parties showed that third parties were not recognised by the sellers.
A delivery order being a document of title to goods, the possession of such a document not only gave the right to recover the goods but also to transfer them to another by endorsement or delivery.
There being two separate transactions of sale, one between the Mills and the original purchasers and the other between the original purchasers and third parties, tax was payable at both the points.
