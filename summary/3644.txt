The appellant purchased the land in question from Gili teppa and Nanjappa during the pendency of the land acquisi tion proceedings under the city of Bangalore Improvement Act 1945.
The acquisition was for building a house colony by the Housing Board whose statutory responsibility is to implement housing schemes.
The appellant challenged the acquisition before the High Court by filing a writ petition.
The High Court dismissed the writ petition.
In an appeal by special leave the appellant contended : 1.
There was non compliance with the mandatory requirement of section 16(2) of the Act which requires the service of notice on "every person whose name appears in the Land Revenue Register as being primarily liable to pay the property tax or land revenue".
Section 15(3) 'provides that the main scheme may provide for the construction of buildings for the proper and working classes including the whole or part of such classes to be displaced in the execution of this scheme.
The appellant whose land is acquired being displaced is entitled to allotment of land for construction of a building.
for his own residence.
Dismissing the appeal, HELD: (1) The High Court on evidence rightly held that in the revenue register the names of predecessors in title of Giliteppa and Nanjappa were shown and that he was given due notice.
The document produced by the appellant was not the revenue register as contemplated by section 16(2).
[167A C, F]: ' (2) Section 15(3) does not impose a compulsory duty or a right in appellant to Claim a plot.
It is clear from rule 10 made under the Act that the person displaced by the acquisition may be accomodated.
However, this is a benefi cient consideration and not a necessary obligation.
[168A C] [The Court observed that in case any land is available, and if the appellant fulfils the other criteria prescribed by the rules the respondent may consider his claim.]
