The appellant decree holders in an execution proceeding accepted delivery of possession and granted a receipt to the Nazir of the Court acknowledging full delivery of possession to them but allowed the respondents, Bengal Breweries, to remain in possession with their permission.
The appellant also permitted the execution case to be dismissed on the basis that full possession had been delivered to them by the respondents.
Sometime thereafter the appellant made a fresh application for execution against the respondent, for eviction which was resisted under section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code alleging that so far as they were concerned, the decree had been fully executed as a result of the earlier execution proceeding which had terminated, and that further execution was not permissible in law.
Held, that it is open to the decree holder to accept delivery of possession under 0. 21, r. 35, of the Code of Civil Procedure without actual removal of the person in possession.
If he does that then he is bound to the position that the decree has been fully executed, and it cannot be executed any more.
Held, further, that on the principle in Saila Bala Dassi vs 681 Nirmala Sundari Dassi whereby the purchaser from the appel lant under a purchase made prior to the appeal was brought on the record of the appeal, a purchaser from the respondent under a conveyance made prior to the appeal could be brought on the record of the appeal.
Saila Bala Dassi vs Nirmala Sundari Dassi, [1958] S.C.R. 1287, followed, Maharaja Jagadish Nath Roy vs Nafay Chandra Paramanik, , approved.
