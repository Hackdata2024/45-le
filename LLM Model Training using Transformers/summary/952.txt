The appellants in execution of a decree passed in their favour for possession over a house obtained possession thereof on July 22, 1951.
The order for delivery of possession was made without notice to and in the absence of the respondent.
The respondent made an application in the Executing Court under sections 47, 144 and 151, Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the ex parte order of delivery and for redelivery of possession of the house to him or in the alternative, for an order to the appellants for giving facilities for removing the moveables from the house.
The Executing Court upheld the contention of the appellant that 76 592 the respondent 's application was not maintainable.
On appeal by the respondent the High Court held that the Executing Court had no jurisdiction to order the eviction of the respondent because of the provisions of the Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Order, 1948, which was in operation on the date of eviction and under sections 9 and 16 of which certain restrictions were placed on the eviction of tenants.
On appeal to this Court by special leave, the appellants contended, inter alia, as they did in the High Court also , that the Mysore House Rent Control Order of 1948 was repugnant to the provisions of the (IV of 1882), which became applicable in the State of Mysore by Part B States (Laws) Act, 1951 (Act III of 1951), which came into force on April 1, 1951 ; and therefore the House Control Order could not operate on the rights of the parties on the day when the Executing Court made the order for delivery of possession to the appellants, i. e., July 9, 1951, or when delivery was actually given i.e., on July 22, 1951.
Held, that the came into force only when it was extended by notification dated September 12, 1951, under section 3 of that Act, i.e., from October 1, 1951, and therefore the Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Order, 1948, was not repealed as from April 1, 1951, when the Part B States (Laws) Act, 1951, came into force and was in force when the possession was delivered.
It was then an existing law which was saved by article 372 of the Constitution and remained unaffected by article 254, and the question of repugnancy to the (Act IV of 1882) did not arise in this case.
M/s. Tilakram Rambaksh vs Bank of Patiala, A.I.R. 1959 Punj.
440, considered.
Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure was applicable to the proceeding out of which this appeal has arisen because the question whether the decree was completely satisfied and therefore the court became functus officio was a matter relating to execution, satisfaction and discharge of the decree.
Ramanna vs Nallaparaju, A, I. R. and J. Marret vs Mohammad Shirazi and Sons, A.I.R. 1930 P. C. 86, considered.
Where the court was not aware of the statutory restriction by which the execution of a decree was prohibited and passed an ejectment decree against a tenant the Executing Court could not execute the decree and any possession given under an ex parte order passed in execution of such a decree could be set aside under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
K.Muhammad Sikri Sahib vs Madhava Kurup, A.I.R. 1949 Mad. 809, considered.
1 The contentions of the appellant based on the ground of res judicata and estoppel were without any force.
Sections 9(1) and 16 of the House Rent Control Order placed restrictions on 593 the power of the Court to execute the decree and ignoring them was not merely an error in the exercise of jurisdiction.
