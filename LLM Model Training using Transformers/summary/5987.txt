An externment order was passed against the respondent under section 56 of the Bombay Police Act on the ground that he was found to be frequently engaged in illegal business of narcotics and was also involved in several cases of riot and criminal intimidation.
The respondent filed an appeal under section 60 of the Act and while the appeal was pending moved the High Court with a writ application.
The State Government dismissed the appeal by a short order.

A reasoned order containing a discussion would probably spark off another round of harassment.
