The respondents in Civil Appeal No. 639 of 1985 claimed possession of the property sold by one Nathu on November 22, 1972 by way of pre emption on the ground that they had superior rights being father 's brother 's sons of Nathu covered under Section 15(1)(a) THIRDLY of the Punjab Pre emption Act, 1913.
The claim was decreed and the alienees ' appellants appeal to the District Judge as also the High Court did not succeed.
Hence this appeal by Special Leave.
In Civil Appeal No. 911 of 1971 respondent No. 1 was the owner of some agricultural property in which appellants plaintiffs claimed to be the cultivating tenants.
Respondent No. 1 sold the aforesaid property on July 22, 1959.
The appellants tenants filed a suit on July 21, 1960 for a decree for possession by pre emption.
The Trial Court, the first appellate court as also the High Court took the view that on the date when the sale took place, the appellants had no right of pre emption and, as such, the claims was not maintainable.
Allowing the appeals, ^ HELD: (In C.A. No. 639 of 1983) 1.
The decree passed by the trial court as upheld in the first and second appeals must be reversed in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Atam Prakash vs State of Haryana, ; holding clauses First, Secondly and Thirdly in section 15(1)(a) as ultra vires the Constitution.
Therefore, section 15(1)(a) THIRDLY is and was not available to the respondents plaintiffs to base their claim of pre emption upon.
[380D] 379 (In C.A. No. 911 of 1971) 2.
All the three Courts have gone wrong in dismissing the claim of the appellants plaintiffs.
They are found entitled to pre empt the alienees under section (15)(1)(a) FOURTHLY of the Act as amended by Act of 1960.
[381E; 382D E] 3.1 It is a well settled principle of law that when the legislature makes provision for a deeming situation to give effect to the mandate of the legislature, all things necessary to effect retrospective intention must be deemed to have existed.
[382C D] 3.2 With effect from February 4, 1960 section 15 of the Punjab Pre emption Act 1913 was amended by Act 10 of 1960.
The inevitable consequence of the retrospective operation of section 31 is to make the substantive provisions of section 15 also retrospective.
It follows that by the fiction introduced by retrospective operation, the rigths which the appellants claimed under the amended provisions of section 15 must be deemed to have vested in them at the relevant time.
Therefore, the appellants must be presumed to have had a right to pre empt on the date of sale.
