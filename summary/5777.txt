PG NO 232 Dismissing the appeal by special leave, HELD: In order to be effective both for the purpose of the judgment in terms of an award and for setting aside the award, the award must be filed in the proper court.
There must be service of notice or intimation or communication of the filing of the said award by the court to the parties.
If all these factors are established or are present, the mode of service of the notice would be irrelevant.
It need not necessarily be in writing.
If the substance is clear the form of the notice is irrelevant but the notice of award having been filed in the court, is necessary.
The filing in the court is necessary and the intimation thereof by the Registry of the court to the parties concerned is essential.
Beyond this there is no statutory requirement of any technical nature under section 14(2) of the .
[234D] It is upon the date of service of such notice that the period of limitation begins and as at present under clause (b) of article 119 of the the limitation expires on the expiry of the thirty days of the service of that notice for an application for setting aside of the award.
l236F] In the instant case, on 4th February, 1978 an affidavit had been filed in the High Court, stating on behalf of the appellant that the award had been wrongly filed in that Court.
The appellant had, therefore, acknowledged that it had notice of the said filing communicated to it by the Court.
The notice can thus be attributed to have been served on the appellant either on 3rd or 4th February, I978, prior to 30th July, 1981.
If that is the position then the application for setting, aside of the award was clearly barred by lapse of time.
