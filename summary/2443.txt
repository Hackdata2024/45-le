The appellant made a gift in 1951 of certain ordinary and preference shares in a company to.
his wife and on the date of transfer the value of the shares was Rs. 69,730.
After the company had converted the preference shares into ordinary shares the appellant 's wife sold most of the shares held by her for Pa. 1,54,800, resulting in a capital gain of Rs. 70,860 as computed under section 12B of the Income Tax Act.
She deposited the entire amount realised from the sale of shares with a firm and thereby earned an interest of Rs. 9,288 per year.
In the appellant 's assessment for 1957 58, the Income Tax Officer included the amount of Rs. 70,860 on the view that the gain resulting from the sale of the shares was the income of the appellant 's wife which arose directly or indirectly from assets transferred by him within the meaning of section 16 (3)(a)(iii) of the Income Tax Act, 1922.
Similarly, in the appellant 's assessment for the year 1958 59 ' and 19591 60, the interest amount of Rs. 9,288 was also included as income within the meaning of section 16 (3) (a) (iii).
In appeals made against the three assessment orders, while the Appellate Assistant Commissioner dismissed the appeal in respect of the assessment year 1957 58 be partly allowed the other two appeals taking the view that only that part of the interest which was attributable to the monetary value of the shares at the time of the gift was liable to be included in the appellant 's total income under section 16 (3)(a)(iii); since the monetary value of the shares gifted to the wife at the time when the gift was made was.
only Rs. 69,730.
the interest attributable to it worked, out at Rs. 4,138 and only this amount could be included in the appellant 's income.
The Appellate.
Tribunal dismissed the appellant 's further appeal and also allowed cross appeals filed by the Department.
The High Court.
upon a reference.
held that the sum of Rs. 70,860 was properly included in the appellant 's income, in 1957 58 but that the interest amount in excess of Rs. 4.138 was not liable to be included in his income for 1958 59 and 1959 60.
In the appeal to this Court the only question for consideration was whether the amount of Rs. 70.860 was the appellant 's income under section 16 (3)(a)(iii).
It was contended on his behalf (i) that what comes within the ambit of section 16(3.)(a)(iii) is the income from the transferred assets.which is different from the profits or gains arising from the sale of the transferred assets.
or in other words "the capital gains" from the transferred assets; and (ii) that section 16(3)(a)(iii) was enacted in 1937 when the word 'income ' did not include 'capital gains ' and income from the property was understood to be income falling under that head in section 6 of Act.
HELD: The High Court had rightly decided that the amount.
of Rs. 70,860 was properly included in the assessees income under section 16 (3) (a) (iii).
361 (i) There is no logical distinction between income arising from the asset transferred to the wife and arising from the sale of the assets so transferred.
The profits or gains which arise from the sale of the asset would arise or spring from the asset, although the operation by which the profits or gain is made to arise out of the asset is the operation of sale.
[364 G H] (ii) Although at the time when section 16(3)(a)(iii) was enacted the definition of 'income ' did not include 'capital gains ', capital gains having been brought within the meaning of 'income ' in section 2(6C), the expression 'income ' as used in section 16(3)(a)(iii) must be construed according to the amended definition of the word and would, therefore, include capital gains.
There is nothing in the context or language of section 16(3)(a)(iii) of the Act to suggest that capital gains are excluded from its scope and there is no reason why a restricted interpretation should be given to the provisions of section 16(3) (a) (iii).
