An order of dismissal of complaint under section 203 Cr.
P.C., has to be made on judicially sound grounds.
It can only be made where the reasons given disclose that the proceedings cannot terminate successfully in a conviction.
A Magistrate is not debarred,.
at this stage, from going into the merits of the evidence produced by the complainant, but the, object of such consideration could only be to whether There are sufficient grounds for proceeding further.
The mere existence of some grounds which would be material in deciding whether the accused should be convicted or acquitted does not generally indicate that the case must necessary fail.
On the other hand, such grounds indicate the need for proceeding further in order to discover the truth after a full and proper investigation.
If, however, a bare perusal of a complaint or the evidence led in support of it show that the essential ingredients of the offences alleged are absent or that the dispute is only of a civil nature or that there are such patent absurdities in the evidence produced that it would be a waste of time to proceed further the complaint could be properly dismissed under the section.
[9176 F H] Where, therefore, the Magistrate dismisses a complaint on a misreading of the oral evidence and the evidence, in fact, does not reveal,any absurdity so as to merit a forthright dismissal of the complaint under the section, such an order is.
fit to be set aside by the High Court.
