The application for review arose out of a judgment passed by this Court it, Civil Appeal No. 707 of 1962.
The appeal arose out of an application filed by a workman of the State Bank under s.33(c)(2) of the industrial Disputes Act before the Labour Court.
He was appointed as a clerk in the Bank on December 14, 1953.
He complained that 'the Bank had not paid him the increment on the basis of the Sastry Award.
His case was that he was entitled under the award to have his annual increment in December each year.
The case of the Bank was that on the basis of the award the workman was entitled to get his annual increment in each year on April 1.
On these facts it was held that the workman would get the benefit of 281 the new scales of pay from the very day of his appointment i.e. from December 14, 1953.
Thus the appeal of the workman was allowed.
Hence the review.
Held that (i) this application failed as this Court did not commit any error in disposing of the appeals.
(ii) in para 292 of the Sastry Award special directions were given as regards the adjustment into the pay scale of the workmen who had joined the service of the Bank after January, 1950, but in their case nothing was said as to the date from which future increments would take effect.
The necessary and inevitable consequence of the absence of any such direction in the matter is that future increments would be on that date of the year when the workman was appointed.
On the facts of this case it was held that the appellant workman would get the increments under the new scale on December 14, each year.
