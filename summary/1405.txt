The appellant a Patwari wrote a letter to the Tehsildar under whom he was working that he had been robbed of certain official papers and money.
The police reported that on investigation, the allegations were found to be false.
The Tehsildar asked the police that a "calendar" be drawn up.
The police launched a prosecution under section 182 of the Indian Penal Code.
No complaint in writing as required by section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was made by the Tehsildar 813 as the public servant concerned in the case, but a charge sheet was put in by the police attaching the letter of the Tehsildar asking them to draw up a "calendar" against the appellant.
^ Held, that in a prosecution to be launched under section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it is incumbent that a complaint in writing should be made by the public servant concerned for only on such complaint can the court take cognizance of the offence otherwise the trial is without jurisdiction ab initio.
Held, further, that section 182 does not require that an action must always be taken on the report made to the public servant, the offence is complete as soon as the report is made and the person who made the report believed that some action would be taken.
