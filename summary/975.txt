The appellant, a non resident for the purposes of the Indian Income tax Act, did not submit returns of certain dividend income accruing to him within the taxable territory.
The Income tax Officer served upon him notices under section 34 read with section 22(2) of the Act for assessment of tax in respect of those years.
The notices in question were issued within eight years from the end of the years of assessment and were within the period prescribed by section 34(i)(a).
The appellant contended that notices for assessment were governed by cl.
(i)(b) of section 34 and not by cl.
(i)(a), even though the appellant had not made a return of his income for the years in question as a general notice under section 22(1) did not give rise to a liability to submit a return and his inaction did not amount to omission or failure to submit a return as he was a non resident, and the assessment proceedings were barred by limitation.
Held, that the expression "every person " in section 22 (1) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, includes all persons who are liable to pay tax and non residents are not exempted from liability to submit a return pursuant to the general notice thereunder.
Once a notice is given by publication in the prescribed manner under section 22(i), every person whether resident or non resident whose income exceeds the maximum amount exempt from tax is obliged to submit a return and if he does not do so, 36 it will be deemed that there was omission on his part to make a return within the meaning of section 34(i)(a) of the Indian Income tax Act.
Section 34(1)(b) applied only to those cases where there was no omission or failure to make a return of the income or to make a full and true disclosure of facts material to the assessment.
In the instant case the proceedings for assessment were pro perly commenced within the period of limitation prescribed by section 34(1)(a).
