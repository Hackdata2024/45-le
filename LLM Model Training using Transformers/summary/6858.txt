The appellants were tenants of certain lands which formed part of a Taluqdari Estate.
These lands though cul tivable were not cultivated for a continuous period of 3 years prior to the coming into Iorce of the Bombay Taluqdari Tenure Abolition Act, 1949.
In the tenant 's appeal to this Court, on the question whether these lands were uncultivated lands within the meaning of Section 6 of the 1949 Act and thus became vested in the State: Dismissing the appeals, this Court, HELD: 1.
The lands in question are clearly covered by the definition of the expression "uncultivated land" as set out in the Explanation to Section 6 of the Bombay Taluqdari Tenure Abolition Act, 1949.
[500 F].
1.1 Even according to the appellants themselves, the lands were under cultivation for some time prior to the coming into force of the said Act and hence it could not be said that they were uncultivable lands.
They were in fact lands which were capable of cultivation and as a matter of fact had been subjected to cultivation for some time but were not cultivated 1or continuous period of three years prior to the coming into force of the Act.
Accordingly the lands must be regarded as "uncultivated lands" for the purposes of Section 6 of the Act and must be deemed to be vested in the State Government.
