Certain structures for residential and business purposes were raised by a tenant of land in the term of Silchar in Assam.
The landlord secured a decree for ejectment against the tenant.
During the pendency of the appeal the Non Agricultural Urban Areas Tenancy Act, Assam Act 12 of 1955 was brought into force.
The tenant claimed protection from eviction under section
The Subordinate Judge held that the tenant had acquired units section 5(1) (a) of the Act the right of a permanent tenant since he had constructed within the pres cribed period structures for residential or business purposes.
He accordingly dismissed the suit.
The High Court in further appeal held that the protection under section 5(1)(a) was not available to the tenant since he had let out to tenants the buildings constructed on the land.
The tenant, by special leave, appealed to this Court.
HELD:(i) The section merely requires that the permanent structure must be one adapted for residential or business purposes.
If the structure is not adapted to such purposes.
the protection of section 5 (1) (a) will not be available.
To read the expression "permanent structure on the land of the tenancy for residential or business purposes" as meaning permanent structure on the land of the tenancy constructed by the tenant for his own residential or business purposes is to add words which are not found in the section.
[116 H].
(ii) Protection is conferred in terms by section 5 upon the tenant of the land and not upon the tenant of the buildings constructed upon the land.
By letting out the structures the tenant of land does not lose the protection given by the statute.
[117 C].
