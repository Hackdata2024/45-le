The 2nd petitioner, a member of the Delhi Higher Judicial Service and working as an Additional District Judge in a writ petition to this Court, contended that he was directly recruited to service as a Scheduled Castes candidate and that the High Court had acted in an unreasonable manner in refusing to grant selection grade to him on more than one occasion.
Disposing of the Writ Petition, ^ HELD: 1.
Where promotion to higher grade or post is made on the criteria of merit, many a time a junior officer is bound to supersede his senior.
In the process of assessment of comparative merit, supersession of a senior officer may result.
This cannot be helped.[614G H] In the instant case, the petitioner was considered on merit along with others, and as the High Court found officers junior to him suitable for grant of selection grade the petitioner could not be selected.
This Court finds no illegality in the High Court 's order.
[615A] 2.
Integrity of a judicial officer is a great asset to administration of justice.
It must be given due weight.
[615C] 3.
The petitioner in the instant case, comes from a weaker section of the society and he has been found to be an honest officer.
This fact needs consideration.
The High Court should consider the petitioner 's 614 case sympathetically for the grant of selection grade at the next selection.
