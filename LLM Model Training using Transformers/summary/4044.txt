The appellant, an office Superintendent was reverted to a lower rank after finding him guilty of some charges held in a departmental enquiry.
The said orders were quashed by the High Court on the ground that the enquiry held was not proper and legal.
The appellant was reinstated as office superintendent.
Later, fresh enquiry was started after placing him under suspension on the basis of the same old charges.
He was found guilty and again reverted to lower rank with a direction in the order of reversion that the allowance paid to him during the period of suspension could remain intact.
The writ petition filed by the appellant against the said orders was dismissed.
Dismissing the appeal by certificate, the Court ^ HELD: 1.
The observations of this Court in State of Assam & Anr.
vs J. N. Ray Biswas [1976] 2 SCR p. 128 @ 130 to the effect that "once a disciplinary case has closed and the official reinstated, presumably on full exoneration, a chagrinned Government cannot restart the exercise in the absence of a specific power to review or revise, vested by rules in some authority" are not applicable to the fact of the Present case.
[197 G H] The earlier order was quashed on a technical ground.
The order of reinstatement does not bring about any distinction in that regard.
The Government had to pass that order because the earlier order of reversion had been quashed by the High Court.
Without reinstating the appellant it would have been difficult, perhaps unlawful, to start a fresh enquiry against the appellant.
[197F G] (b) The reduced amount paid to the appellant for the period of suspension was affirmed by making in a part of the order of reversion itself, and is in order.
[197H, 198H]
