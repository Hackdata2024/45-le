The Income tax Officer, Bangalore commenced a proceeding under section 34 of the Mysore Income tax Act for reassessment of the income of the respondents for the assessment year 1949 50 and served a notice in that behalf in March 1951, on the respondents.
The Income tax Officer determined the total income of the respondents in May 1954, but the order was set aside by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner in November 1961, and the Income tax Officer was directed to make a fresh inquiry, When the Income tax Officer commenced inquiry, the respondents applied to the High Court for a writ of prohibition and the High Court passed an order restraining the Income tax Officer on the ground that the assessment proceeding was barred because of the expiry of the period of limitation.
In appeal to this Court, Held: The High Court was in error, because, though the Appellate Assistant Commissioner vacated the Income tax Officer 's assessment order of 1954 and remanded the case for further inquiry, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner did not set aside the notice of March 1951 served on the respondents, If a proper notice was served within the period provided by the section (four years from the close of the assessment year) the proceeding could be completed even after the expiry of four years for the Act prescribes no period for completion of the proceeding.
