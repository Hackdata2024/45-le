An agreement was entered into by appellants Nos. 1 to 4 and respondent No. 1 regarding partition of joint movable and immovable properties.
A dispute arose relating to certain properties, which was referred to arbitration.
The arbitrators made their award on November 28, 1977, which was filed by them before the Sub Judge on January 28, 1978, pursuant to the application made by appellants Nos. 1 to 4 under section 14 of the Act.
On December 1, 1977, respondent No. I had filed an application under section 11 of the , before the Munsif, who passed an injunction order on July 26, 1978, for maintaining status quo till the disposal of the said application.
On the application made by the arbitrators on 14th August, 1978, the Sub Judge ordered on September 2, 1978, the returning back of the award to the arbitrators, to enable them to present the same for registration before the Sub Registrar.
The High Court in appeal set aside the above order holding that during the subsistence of the interim injunction to maintain status quo, the arbitrators could not take back the award for presenting it for registration.
and ordered that the arbitrators ' application be kept pending and 119 heard when the injunction order was vacated.
On December 20, 1982 the Munsif dismissed the case of the respondent No. 1 and that interim injunction ipso facto was discharged.
Thereafter, the Subordinate Judge dismissed the application of the arbitrators for returning of the award, holding that limitation for registration of the award had already expired.
The High Court, in appeal, directed the Subordinate Judge to return back the award, holding that it was the Registrar and not the Sub Judge who could determine the question of limitation for the purpose of registration of the award.
On November 24, 1983, the arbitrators got back the award and the next day presented it before the Sub Registrar and the award was registered the same day.
The High Court on a petition by respondent No. 1 challenging the registration sent back the award to the Sub Registrar to re consider the question of limitation.
The Sub Registrar found that the award was presented within time as the period during which the judicial proceedings were pending, namely, 28th January, 1978 to 24th November, 1983, should be excluded in view of section 15 of the .
Against the aforesaid decision, respondent No. 1 filed an application before the High Court which, by the impugned order, quashed the registration and held that the award had been presented for registration beyond time.
In the appeal by special leave, the validity and propriety of the aforesaid order was challenged.
Allowing the appeal by special leave, this Court, ^ HELD: Under the , the limitation period for registration is four months from the date of execution and in cases where the delay in presentation does not exceed four months, such document could be accepted for registration, on payment of fine.
The cumulative effect of sections 23 and 25 read together is that a total period of eight months is available for registration, if the conditions requisite are fulfilled.
[122G; 123A B] G In the instant case, the award was made on November 28, 1977 and before the expiry of four months, it was filed in the court pursuant to the order of the court.
During the period from July 26, 1978 to December 20, 1982, there was subsisting injunction preventing the arbitrators from taking any steps.
Furthermore, as the award was in H 120 the custody of the court from January 28, 1978 till the return of the award to the arbitrators on November 24, 1983, the arbitrators or the parties could not have presented the award for its registration during that time.
The award was presented before the Sub Registrar on November 25, 1983 the very next day of getting possession of the award from the court.
The Sub Registrar, pursuant to the order of the High Court, found that the award was presented within time as the period during which judicial proceedings were pending from January 28, 1978 to November 24, 1983 should be excluded in view of the principle laid down in section 15 of the Act.
[123G H; 124A,D E] The High Court was, therefore, wrong in holding that the only period which should be excluded was from 26th January, 1978, the date of the order of the Munsif directing maintenance of status quo till 20th December, 1982, the date when the interim injunction was vacated.
The award was still in the custody of the court and there was ample evidence that the Arbitrators had tried to obtain the custody of the award which the court declined to give to them.
[124E G] The two legal maxims LEX NON COGIT AU IMPOSSIBILIA, and ACTUS CURIAE NEMINEM GRAVABIT the law does not compel a man to do that which he cannot possibly perform, and an act of the Court shall prejudice no man would apply with full vigour in the facts of this case.
