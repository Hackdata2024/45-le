By section 312 of the , "Any assignment of his office made after the commencement of this Act by any direc tor of a company shall be void.
" 42 330 The managing director of a private company, empowered by the terms of the agreement between him and the company and the articles thereof to appoint, by deed or by will, any person to be the managing director in his place and stead, died leaving a will whereby he appointed one of the appellants the managing director in his place from the date of his death.
The High Court took the view that the word 'assignment ' in the section included 'appointment ' and as such the appointment in question was void.
Held, that section 312 of the , cannot be interpreted in such a way as to bring it into conflict with section 255 of the Act since its language does not compel such an interpretation.
The word 'assignment ' in that section does not mean appointment and the section is intended to render a transfer of his office by a director void and not an appointment by him of his successor.
Section 255 of the Act, which expressly permits directors to be appointed otherwise than by the company, shows that, sub ject to the limit as to numbers prescribed by it, a director, authorised by the articles of the company, can appoint another to take his office when rendered vacant by his resignation or death or on expiry of his term of office.
The proviso to section 86B of the old Act cannot lend any support to the argument that the word 'assignment ' in section 312 of the new Act includes 'appointment '.
