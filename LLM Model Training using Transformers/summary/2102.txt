In the course of an altercation between neighbours the first respondent slapped the appellant 's servant and threw a file of papers at the appellant 's husband which missed him but hit the appellant on the elbow, causing a scratch.
On a prosecution being launched the Presidency Magistrate convicted the first respondent under section 323 of the Indian Penal Code.
The High Court however held that the offending act came within the General Exception in section 95 of the Indian Penal Code as it was trivial.
In appeal to this Court the appellant contended that: (1) Section 95 applies only when the act of the accused is accidental and not deliberate; (2) the section cannot be invoked if the harm caused consists of physical injury.
HELD:(i) It cannot be said that harm caused by doing an act with intent to cause harm or with the knowledge that harm may be caused thereby will not fall within the terms of section 95.
The section applies if the act causes harm or is intended to cause harm or is known to be likely to cause harm, provided the harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense or temper would complain of such harm.
[125 F] (ii) There is nothing in section 95 to justify the contention that the word 'harm ' as used in that section does not include physical injury.
Section 95 is a general exception and that word has in many other sections dealing with general exceptions a wide connotation inclusive of physical injury.
There is no reason to suppose that the Legislature intended to use the expression 'harm ' in section 95 in a restricted sense.
[126 A B] (iii)Whether, an offence is trivial must depend on the nature of the injury, the position of the parties, the knowledge or intention with which the offending act is done, and other related matters.[126 CD]
