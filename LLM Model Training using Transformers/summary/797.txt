The retrenched workmen of the appellant concern who were paid compensation as provided in s 25F of the , claimed that they were entitled to be paid in addition gratuity under the gratuity scheme in force in the appellant concern as modified by the award of the industrial tribunal dated August 18, 1952.
The award provided: " The following gratuity scheme shall be for cases of retrenchment or termination of service by the company for any reason other than misconduct or for cases of resignation with the consent of the management".
The Appellate Tribunal took the view that gratuity provided under the award was different from compensation on retrench ment payable to a workman under section 25F of the Act.
Held, that on a proper construction of the award the amount payable thereunder to the workmen on retrenchment though called gratuity was really compensation on account of retrenchment as provided under section 25F of the Act, and that the workmen were only entitled to one or the other, whichever was more advantageous to them in view of section 25J of the Act.
It was not the intention of the legislature that a workman on retrenchment should get compensation twice, i.e., once under the Act and once again under the scheme in force providing for retrenchment compensation, by whatever name the payment might have been called.
