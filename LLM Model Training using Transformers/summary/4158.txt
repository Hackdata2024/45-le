Dismissing the Writ Petition, the Court ^ HELD: The University wise allocation of seats is valid.
Under the existing scheme, the classification for purposes of quota is university wise, not territory wise.
Belonging to backward Calicut District is not the same as being an alumnus of the Calicut University.
May be, the State could have classified candidates University wise, backward region wise or otherwise, separately or in any constitutionally permissible combination.
Mystic maybes are beyond judicial conjecture.
The misfortune of the petitioner is damnum sine injuria.
Every adversity is not an injury.
Judicial remedy cannot heal every wound or cure every sore since the discipline of the law keeps courts within its bounds.

vs Union of India & Ors.
; relied on Observation: [Too long has the State been seeking ad hoc solutions and improvising remedies where comprehensive studies and enduring recipes are the desideratum.
To keep the education situation uncertain across the national and the fate of students of higher education tense or in suspense with annual challenges in court or agitational exercises in the streets is dangerous procrastination fraught with negative results where a creative undertaking of responsibility to find an enduring answer to a chronic problem is the minimum that the country expects of the concerned State instrumentality.] [830 E G]
