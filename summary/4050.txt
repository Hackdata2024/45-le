HELD: Section 7 read with Section 16 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act is constitutionally valid.
[257G] Policy is for Parliament, constitutionality is for the Court.
Protection of public health and regulation of noxious trade belong to the police power of the State and Legislation like the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act is of that genre.
[256F G] If a sentence, as in the instant Act, is prescribed as a mandatory minimum and that is too cruel to comport with article 21 and too torturesome to be reasonably justifiable or socially defensible under Article 19, then a case for judicial review may arise.
[256 G H] Judge proof sentencing is not per se bad.
Sometimes judicial fluctuations in punishment, especially on the softer side where white collar criminals are involved, induce legislative standardization of sentences, to avoid giving societal protection in hostage to fortune.
There is a wide play still left for the Court, and mandatory minima are familiar from the days of the Penal Code.
[256H, 257A] The prescription of equal protection is not breached either, because within the range of judicial discretion the Court deals out to each what he deserves according to established principles.
[257B] Observation (a) Public authorities entrusted with the enforcement of regulatory provisions to protect society may, in proper cases, examine those prosecutions which are harassments to the humbler folk even if they technically violate the law and cause only minimal harm to society and decide whether they should at all sanction their prosecution.
[257D E] (b) The Legislature, in its wisdom, may also consider the advisability of resting power somewhere to reduce the sentence without the bigger offender escaping through these wider meshes meant for the smaller offenders.
Even otherwise, there is a general power in the Executive to commute sentences and such power can be put into action on a principled basis when small men get caught by the law.
