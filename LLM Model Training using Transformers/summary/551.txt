The appellant was convicted by the Municipal Magistrate under section 488, read with section 299, of the Calcutta Municipal Act, 1923, and sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 75, for failure to carry out within the specified time the terms of a notice served on him under section 299 of the Act to remove the encroachment caused by a compound wall upon the road side land of the Municipality.
Since the offending structure was a compound wall and not something which was part and parcel of the main building, the offence comes under section 300 and not section 299, read with section 488 Of the Act.
The High Court, in revision, found that the accused was fully aware of the nature of the accusation against him and that there was no prejudice caused to him by the wrong mention of section 299 in the notice in place Of section 300.
It accordingly altered the conviction into one under section 488, read with section 300, and reduced the amount of fine to Rs. 5o as required by the section.
On appeal to the Supreme Court it was contended for the appellant that the conviction was bad because (1) the notice having been headed as under section 299 of the Act, the conviction under section 300 was illegal, (2) the requisition had not been lawfully made within the meaning Of section 488(1)(c), and (3) there was substantial prejudice to the appellant inasmuch as if the conviction were under section 299 and 775 not section 300, read with section 488, he might have been entitled to claim compensation : Held, that the effective part of the notice made it clear that the requisition, which was to remove the encroachment caused by the compound wall, was lawfully made, that the alteration of the conviction under section 299 to one under section 300 would not make it illegal and that, on the facts, there was no prejudice.
Begu vs The King Emperor, L.R. 52 I.A. 191, relied on.
