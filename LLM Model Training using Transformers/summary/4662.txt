The appellants filed a civil suit against the respondents for recovery of certain amount of money and produced some original documents with the plaint.
The first respondent filed a complaint against the appellants alleging forgery of his signature on one such document and thereby commission or offences punishable under sections 467 and 471 I.P.C.
The appellants objected to maintainability of the criminal action and later moved the High Court for quashing the said proceedings.
The appellants contended that in the absence of complaint from the civil court the prosecution was barred in view of section 195 (1)(b)(ii) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The High Court dismissed tho application and observed that section 463 I.P.C. cannot be construed to include section 467.
Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: The prosecution would not be sustainable.
[842 B] Section 195(1)(b)(ii) of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence described in section 463.
Of the Penal Code, when such offence is alleged to have been committed in respect of a document produced . in a proceeding in any Court . except on the complaint in writing of that Court.
Section 463 of the Penal Code in a sense defines the offence of forgery and the offence which is made punishable under section 467 is in respect of an offence described in section 463.
Once it is accepted that section 463 defines forgery and section 467 punishes forgery of a particular category, the provision in section 195(l)(b)(ii) of the Code of Criminal Procedure would immediately be attracted and on the basis that the offence punishable under section 467 of the Penal Code is an offence described in section 463, in the absence of a complaint by the Court the prosecution would not be maintainable.
