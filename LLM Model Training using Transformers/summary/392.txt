The appellant sued the State of Orissa for a declaration that the Orissa Estates Abolition Act of 1951 was in its application to the Kanika Raj, of which he was the Raja and owner, invalid, unconstitutional and ultra vires the State Legislature and for an injunction restraining the State of Orissa from taking any action under the Act.
It was contended, inter alia, that no notification under section 3(1) of the Act vesting the Kanika Raj in the State of Orissa could issue as the Raj was not an estate as defined by section 2 (g) of the Act.
The contrary was asserted by the State of Orissa and its further contention was that the appellant was estopped by a compromise decree between his predecessors in title on the one band and the Secretary of State on the other from denying that the Raj was an estate as defined by the Act.
Held, that the Kanika Raj was an estate as defined by the Orissa Estates Abolition Act of 1951 and the appellant was estopped from denying it by the compromise decree.
That the real intention of the Act in defining 'estate ' as it has done in section 2(g) of the Act, was to include all lands, such as the appellant 's, which were as a matter of fact included ill the register prepared under the Bengal Land Registration Act Of 1876, and in construing the definition it is wholly unnecessary to consider whether such inclusion was valid or proper or in conformity with the meaning of an estate under that Act.
That a judgment by consent is as effective in creating an estoppel between the parties as a judgment on contest and the test is whether the judgment in the previous case could have been passed without the determination of the question which is put in issue in the subsequent case where the plea of estoppel is raised.
Held further, that there is no rule corresponding to Rule 4 of Order XIX of the Supreme Court Rules imposing a similar disability on the respondent, and even with regard to the appellant the court may in appropriate cases, give him leave to raise a ground not specified in the Statement of the Case filed by him.
