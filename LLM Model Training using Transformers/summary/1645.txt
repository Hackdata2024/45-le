The appellant was convicted by the Sessions judge of the offence of murder of K and sentenced to death, and the con viction and sentence were confirmed by the High Court.
The committal proceedings disclosed that the Magistrate committed the accused to the Court of Session without recording the evidence of the witnesses to the actual commission of the offence.
Held that under section 207A of the Code of Criminal Pro cedure, 1898, as amended by Act 26 of 1955, a Magistrate., has 993 been given a discretion in the matter of examination of witnesses not produced by the prosecutor.
The prosecutor is expected ordinarily to examine in the court of the committing Magistrate all witnesses to the actual commission of the offence, but if without adequate reasons he fails to do so, the Magistrate is justified and, in enquiries on charges of serious offences like murder, is under a duty to call witnesses who would throw light upon the prosecution case.
A Magistrate failing to examine witnesses to the actual commission of the offence because they are not produced, without considering whether it is not necessary in the interests of justice to examine such witnesses, fails in the discharge of his duties.
The Magistrate must apply his mind to the documents referred to in section 173 of the code and the testimony of witnesses, if any, produced by the prosecutor and examined, and consider whether in the interests of justice it is necessary to record the evidence of other witnesses.
A Magistrate in committing a person accused of an offence for trial has to perform a judicial function which has a vital importance in the ultimate trial, and a slipshod or mechanical dealing with the proceeding must be deprecated.
