2.A Court intervening under the undoubtedly has the power to grant permanent alimony or maintenance, if that power is invoked at the juncture when the marital status is affected or disrupted.
It also retains the power subsequently to be invoked on application by a party entitled to relief.
A nd such order, in all events, remains within the jurisdiction of that court, to be altered or modified as future situations may warrant.
3.While sustaining her marriage and preserving her marital status, a Hindu wife 's claim to maintenance is codified is S.18 of the Hindu Adoptions 956 and Maintenance Act, 1956 and must necessarily be agitated thereunder.

5.When distinctive claims are covered distinctly under two different statutes, choosing of one forum or the other, are not mere procedural technicalities or irregularities.
These are matters which go to the root of the jurisdiction.
The matrimonial court, a court of special jurisdiction.
is not meant to pronounce upon a claim of maintenance without having to go into the exercise of passing a decree which implies that unless it goes onwards, Moves or leads through, to affect or disrupt the marital status between the parties.
By rejecting a claim, the matrimonial court does make an appealable decree.
in terms of section 28, but neither affects nor disrupts the marriage.
It certainly does not pass a decree in terms of section 25 for its decision has not moved or done anything towards, or led through, to disturb the marriage, or to confer or to take away any legal character or status.
