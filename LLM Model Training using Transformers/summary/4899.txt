Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules requires the Food Inspector to send 250 gms of suji (semolina) for analysis.
On August 1, 1975 a Food Inspector purchased a sample of 200 gms of suji from the respondent accused and sent the same to the Public Analyst for analysis.
Though the report indicated that the sample was found to contain excessive moisture and ash, the Metro politan Magistrate, Delhi acquitted the accused by his judgment dated July 19, 1977 on the ground that the Food Inspector did not send the required quantity of the adulterated article for analysis.
The High Court of Delhi dismissed the revision application filed by the Municipal Corporation.
Hence the appeal by special leave.
Dismissing the appeal, the Court, ^ HELD: The fact that a lesser quantity than that prescribed by the Rules is sent for analysis cannot constitute an impediment in the conviction of a person accused of selling adulterated food, so long as the quantity sent for analysis is sufficient to enable the Analyst to make a satisfactory analysis according to accepted tests.
Therefore, a conviction could be recorded under section 7 read with section 16 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act.
