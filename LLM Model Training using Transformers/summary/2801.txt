The assessee was an individual.
She was entitled for her life, to an aliquot share of the income arising from the funds settled on trust by three trust deeds and 'received payments of such share.
She also possessed jewellery, intended for her personal use, of the value of Rs. 80,000.
On the questions : (1) whether the payments to the assessee were annuities falling within the scope of section 2(e)(iv) of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957, whose value could not be included in the computation of her net wealth; and (2) whether the value of the jewels was exempt under section 5(1) (viii).
HELD : (1) Under the trust deeds, the assessee was not entitled to any fixed sum of money.
Therefore, the payments to the assessee under the trust deeds could not be considered as annuities and hence, she was not entitled to the benefit of section 2(e)(iv).
