The manager of an undivided Hindu family consisting of himself, his brother and their step mother, instituted a suit for recovery of the amount due under a mortgage belonging to the family.
The step mother who was interested in the mortgagee right was not made a party to the suit.
Though the manager (the first plaintiff) did not describe himself as the manager in the plaint, the allegations in the plaint showed that the suit was filed on behalf of the joint family.
No objection as to non joinder was raised in the trial court, but when the appeal was pending in the High Court the step mother was added as a party on her applica tion.
The contesting defendants pleaded that as all persons having an interest in the mortgage security were not joined as parties within the period of limitation prescribed for a suit to enforce the mortgage, and the first plaintiff did not, in any case, purport to institute the suit in his capacity as the manager, the suit must fail.
Held: (1) that the failure to join a person who is a proper but not a necessary party does not affect the maintainability of the suit nor does it invite the application of section 22 Of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908 ; (2) that the question whether a suit as instituted by the manager of an undivided Hindu family in his personal capacity or as representing the family depends upon the circumstances of each case and that the failure of the plaintiff to describe himself as the manager in the plaint is not decisive of the question.
(1) (2) 897 In the resent case, the step mother was not a necessary party, and the facts showed that the suit was instituted by the first plaintiff in his capacity as manager.
Accordingly, the suit was maintainable.
