Allowing the appeal.
^ HELD: For making the provisions of section 17(1) applicable: (a) the land in respect of which the urgency provision is being applied should be waste or arable and (b) there should be an urgency for taking immediate possession requiring dispensation of the right of the owner for filing an objection under section 5A and this right should not be interfered in a casual or cavalier manner.
[94C, F] In the instant case the Notification under section 17(4) of the Act neither mentioned that the land is waste or arable nor that there was urgency to take recourse to the provisions of the Act.
[94D] The direction given to the Collector to take action under Section 17 on the ground of urgency is not a legal and complete fulfillment of the requirement of the law.
