A receiver cannot be appointed in execution of a decree in respect of a compulsory deposit in a Provident Fund due to the judgment debtor.
Whatever doubts may have existed under the earlier Act of 1897, the definition of "compulsory deposit" in section 2 (a) of the Provident Funds Act (XlX of 1925) clearly includes deposits remaining to the credit of the subscriber or depositor after he has retired from serv ice.
Arrears of salary and allowances stand upon a different footing and are not exempt from being proceeded against in execution.
