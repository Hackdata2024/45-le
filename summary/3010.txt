Under section 3AA of the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act, 1948 "not withstanding anything contained in section 3 or 3A" tax on the turnover of the goods specified therein was not leviable except at the point of sale by a dealer to the consumer.
Section 3D, incorporated into the Act later, authorised the imposition of a tax on the turnover of first purchase and on the issue of a notification under the section no tax could be levied under any other section in respect of the goods so notified.
On the question whether the notification dated October 1, 1964 imposing a purchase tax on oil seeds was invalid for the reason that it contravened section 3AA of the Act, HELD : It is open to the State Government to levy purchase tax, in exercise of its powers under section 3D, in respect of goods covered by section 3AA.
At the time the legislature incorporated into the Act section 3D it must have been aware of the existence of section 3AA, yet, in sub section
(4) of section 3D it declared that on the issue of a notification under the section, no tax shall be levied under any other section in respect of the goods so notified.
The ambit of this provision is very wide and it clearly takes in goods mentioned in section 3AA.
Further, the non obstante clause does not take in section 3D, and if the legislature intended to exclude the operation of section 3D, in respect of matters covered by section 3AA nothing would have been easier than to say so.
Therefore, there are no grounds to cut down the amplitude of the power conferred on the State Government under sub section
(4) of section 3 D. [150 H 151 D]
