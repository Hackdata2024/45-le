It is well settled that the decisions of a Tribunal on questions of fact are final and that the Supreme Court would interfere only in cases where (1) the Tribunal acts in excess of the jurisdiction conferred upon it under the statute or regulation creating it or where it ostensibly fails to exercise a patent jurisdiction; (2) there is an error apparent on the face of the decision; (3) the Tribunal has erroneously applied well accepted principles of jurisprudence.
The Bengal Chamber of Commerce of which the respondent Company was a member, had made an investigation into the cost of living index for the middle class families and, fixed the dearness allowance payable to the employees of the mercantile firms in Calcutta.
Before the Industrial Tribunal as well as the Labour Appellate Tribunal the claim was put forward on behalf of the appellants (the clerks of the respondent Company) that the dearness allowance for them should be at the same rates as those decided upon by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce in respect of the middle classes to which the appellants belonged and they contended that the procedure adopted by the Labour, Appellate Tribunal leaving out 20 points of the living cost index un neutralised was not justifiable.
Held, that in matters of the grant of dearness allowance there cannot be a hard and fast rule applicable to all kinds of employees and except in the very lowest class of manual labourers it is not proper to neutralise the entire rise in the cost of living by dearness allowance.
There are different grades among the middle classes and the appellants cannot claim to have the same rates of dearness allowance as those fixed for the clerks of the mercantile firms by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce.
