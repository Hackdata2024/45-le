(1) The unfettered discretionary powers conferred on the Supreme Court and the High Courts by articles 136 and 226 of the Constitution respectively cannot be taken away or whittled down by the legislature and therefore section 105 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which provides that every order of the tribunal under the Act shall be final and conclusive did not affect such powers.
(2) In view of the provisions of section 16 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, and the provisions of sections 33 (2) and 123 (8) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, an election to a State Legislative Assembly is not invalidated when the elected member is either nominated or seconded or both by a Government servant or servants.
(3) The Supreme Court recorded its disapproval of the way in which the Election Tribunal shirked its duty and tried to take a short cut in deciding only two of the twelve issues framed and thus acted against the provisions of section 99 of the Act.
