The appellant is a manufacturer of various types of food products known as Sapaghetti, Macaroni, Vermicelli, etc., failing under Heading No. 1902.10 of the Central Excise Tariff Act.
The said goods had been made dutiable only by the Finance Bill 1987 88 with effect from Ist March, 1987.
The appellant claimed that their pre budget stocks of fully manufactured non excisable goods were entitled to duty free clearance.
The Assistant Collector of Central Excise, the Collector of Central Excise (Appeals) and the Tribunal rejected the claim of the appellant.
Before this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the relevant date would be the date of manu facture and in this case the manufacture was complete before the introduction of the budget.
Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: (1) Excise is a duty on manufacture or production.
But the realisation of the duty may be postponed for admin istrative convenience to the date of removal of goods from the factory.
Rule 9A of the Central Excise Rules merely does that.
[314C] (2) The scheme of the Act read with the relevant rules framed under the Act, particularly rule 9A, reveals that the taxable even is the fact of manufacture or production of an excisable article, the 312 payment of duty is related to the date of removal of such article from the factory.
[313F] (3) On the basis of rule 9A of the Central Excise Rules, the Central Excise authorities were within the competence to apply the rate prevailing on the date of removal.
