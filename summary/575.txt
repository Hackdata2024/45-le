The respondent No. I was a journalist supplying news to the petitioner 's newspaper on payment of a fixed monthly honorarium.
Contrary to the petitioner 's instructions the respondent No. I left India and thereupon the petitioner terminated the arrangement.
Upon his return to India the respondent No. I requested the petitioner to reconsider its decision but the petitioner declined to do so.
The respondent No. I applied to the State Government under section 17 Of tile Working Journalists (Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1955 claiming a large sum of money from the petitioner.
The State Government nominated respondent NO. 2 as the authority under section 17 of the Act and referred the claim to him.
The petitioner disputed the whole claim and contended that the respondent NO. 2 had no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the merits of the disputed claim: Held, that the authority specified under section 17 of the Act had no jurisdiction to determine the amount due as the section merely provided for a procedure to recover an amount from the employer which had previously been determined by a competent authority or court.
If the legislature had intended that the enquiry under section 17 should include the examination of the merits of the claim and a decision thereon, it would have made appropriate provisions conferring upon the State Government or the specified authority the relevant powers essential for the purpose of effectively holding such an enquiry; but no such powers had been conferred.
