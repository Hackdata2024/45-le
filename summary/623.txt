In a suit instituted on behalf of a Hindu minor for partition of the joint family properties, the minor plaintiff died during the pendency of the suit and his mother as the legal representative was allowed to continue the suit as the second plaintiff, and the suit was decreed as it was found that the defendants had been acting against the interests of the minor and that the suit for partition was therefore beneficial to him.
It was contended for the appellants that the suit had abated by reason of the death of the minor before the suit was heard and before the Court could decide whether the institution of the suit was for his benefit.
Held, that when a suit is instituted by a person acting on behalf of a minor for the partition of the joint family properties, a declaration made by him on behalf of the minor to become divided brings about a severance in status, subject only to the decision of the Court that the action is beneficial to the minor.
The true effect of the decision of the Court is not to create in the minor a right which he did not possess before but to recognise the right which had accrued to him when the action was instituted.
Rangasayi vs Nagarathnamma, Mad. 95, Ramsingh vs Fakira, I. L. R. and Mandilprasad vs Ramcharanlal, I.L.R. , approved.
Case law reviewed.
Accordingly, the suit did not abate and the legal represen tative was entitled to continue the suit and obtain a decree on showing that when the suit was instituted it was for the benefit of the minor.
Held, further, that the suit did not abate on the ground either that the cause of action for a suit for partition by a minor was one personal to him, because such a suit is one relating to property.
