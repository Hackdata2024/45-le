Where a patnidar has obtained a decree against his zemindar for possession of resumed chaukidari chakran lands with mesne profits from the date on which the zemindar wrongfully took 783 possession of them, the zemindar is not entitled to deduct by way of equitable set off from the amount of mesne profits payable by him under the decree, the amounts due to him on account of rent, revenue and cesses for a period subsequent to the date of delivery of possession of the lands inasmuch as the two cross demands do not arise out of the same trans action.
The transaction which led to the plaintiff 's demand for mesne profits resulted from the defendant 's wrongful act as trespasser, while the transaction which gave rise to the zemindar 's demand arose out of the relationship of landlord and tenant and the obligations resulting therefrom.
