Respondent carried out the repairs.
On June 8, 1957, the Executive Engineer inspected again in compliance with tile order of the Rent Controller And was satisfied that the pillar had been repaired satisfactorily.
The Rent Controller held that the case fell within section 13 (3) (a) of the Act and ordered eviction of the Respondent.
On appeal the District judge taking note of the state of repairs allowed the appeal.
In revision under section 15(5) of the Act the High Court judge held that the powers of the High Court in revision were similar to those under section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code and that there was no question of jurisdiction involved in the case.
He, however, affirmed the decision after considering the evidence.
Held, that the powers of the High Court under section 15 (5) of the Act were manifestly wider than those under section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code and were not confined to questions of jurisdiction.
That under section 13(3z(a) the requirement of vacant possession.
by the landlord could only be for the purpose of carrying out such fundamental and extensive repairs as could not be carried out without evicting the tenant and not for minor repairs and that it Was open to the District Judge to consider the subsequent events upto the time when eviction was ordered by the controller in view of the scheme and purpose of the legislation.
