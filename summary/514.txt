Respondent obtained a decree for ejectment against the appellant, a thika tenant, and filed an application for execution of the decree before the civil Court.
Appellant resisted the application on the ground that in view Of section 5(1) Of the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949, the civil Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the application.
Section 5(1) provides that a landlord wishing to eject a thika tenant on the grounds specified in section 3 shall apply to the Controller in that behalf.
