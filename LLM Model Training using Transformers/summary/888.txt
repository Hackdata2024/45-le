In the, Indian State of Vadia succession was governed by primogeniture.
The Ruler in 1943 granted to his younger son, the petitioner, a village in the State in perpetuity and in heredity for enjoyment as 'Kapal Giras ' as ' Bhayat '.
In 1947 the State of Vadia acceded to the Dominion of India and by subsequent constitutional developments it became merged in the State of Saurashtra.
After the coming into force of the Constitution the elder son of the Ruler and then the Ruler died, and the petitioner was recognised as the Ruler.
Thereupon the State of Saurashtra issued a notification resuming the grant as it was deemed to have lapsed and reverted to the former Vadia State.
The petitioner contended that the grant was absolute and unconditional for 522 permanent enjoyment from generation to generation and the State could not resume it: Held, that the grant lapsed on the petitioner becoming the Ruler and the State could resume it.
The grant was to the petitioner as a " Bhayat ", which word meant a cadet or the descendant of a younger branch of a Talukdar 's family where the estate followed the rule of primogeniture; as such if enured for his benefit as long as he remained a cadet.
But when the grantee became the Ruler and ceased to be a " Bhayat ", the grant came to an end.
