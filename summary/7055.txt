The respondent industry entered into an agreement with the appellant Board for supply of electricity on 5th March, 1965.
Under the agreement, which was valid for five years i.e. upto 5th March 1970, consumer was obliged to pay certain minimum charges in any event.
However, on 30th April, 1968 supply of electricity to respondent was disconnected for non payment of electricity charges.
Since the respondent also failed to pay the minimum charges for the period subsequent to the date of disconnection, the Electricity Board riled a suit for the amount due on account of the electricity consumed upto April 30, 1968 and for the minimum charges from May 1, 1968 to March 5, 1970.
The Trial Court decreed the suit.
The respondent preferred an appeal before the High Court which sustained the Trial Court 's decree only for the period upto the date of disconnection but disallowed the claim for the period subsequent to the date of disconnection on the ground that since the respondent did not avail of any energy whatsoever during the period subsequent to the disconnection it was not liable to pay the minimum charges for that person.
In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the Electricity Board that in view of the judgment of this Court in the case of Bihar State Electricity Board, Patna and Ors.
vs M/s Creen Rubber Industries and Ors., [1990] 1 S.C.C. 731 the respondent was liable to pay the minimum charges for the period subsequent to disconnection.
861 Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order of the High Court, this Court, HELD: Clause (13) of the agreement between the parties does oblige the consumer to pay a certain minimum charges in any event.
The judgment and decree of the Trial Court is restored.
[862 E, 863 D] Bihar State Electricity Board, Patna & Ors.
vs M/s Green Rubber Industries and Ors., [1990] 1 S.C.C. 731, relied on.
