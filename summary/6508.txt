The petitioners, claiming to be daily rated workmen of the respondent Corporation in a writ before the High Court demanded regularisation of their services and equal pay for equal work on the ground that they were discharging the same duties as the regular workers.
Their claim was contested by the respondents on the ground that there was no work for them for a long time and they had been continued on rolls on humanitarian grounds.
The High Court rejected their claim.
In their counter affidavit to the special leave petition it was stated on behalf of the respondents that there was no vacancy in the establishment to absorb the petitioners, that they were surplus to the requirement of the project and that it had proposed a scheme of voluntary retirement for their benefit which some of them had accepted.
Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court, HELD: 1.
The principle of regularisation of a daily rated workmen and payment to him of the pay equal to that of a regular workman arises only when he is doing the same work as the regular workman and there being a vacancy available for him, he is not absorbed against it or not even paid the equal pay for the period during which the same work is taken from him.
[620E F] 2.
In the instant case, there were no vacancies or work available in the establishment for absorption of the peti tioners.
The question of directing their absorption and regularisation, therefore, does not arise.
However, they be given the benefit of the voluntary retirement scheme and paid the specified amounts in addition to other dues.
