Exercising power under sections 47 and SO of the (which clothe the Commissioner of Police with externment powers for keeping the capital city free of crime) the Deputy Commissioner of Police Delhi directed the appellant to show cause why he should not be externed from the Union Territory of Delhi.
The allegations against him were that his activities in the area of police station Connaught Place and the areas adjoining the police station were causing and were calculated to cause harm, alarm and danger to the residents of the said localities and areas that he kept a knife with him for unlawful purposes and threatened residents of that area with dire consequences and deterred them from reporting to the police and that he had engaged himself in the commission of offences against persons and property with force and violence.
In his petition under Article 32 of the Constitution challenging the vires of the externment proceedings as arbitrary and unreasonable restrictions on his freedom of movement, the petitioner stated that over the past 25 years with the indulgence of the local police he used to park his mobile refrigerated water carts on the road side in front of a cinema theatre in Delhi and that in return for the indulgence shown to him by the police and to keep them in good humour he yielded to their pressure and gave false testimony in as many as 3000 cases.
Even though Courts had dubbed him as a stock witness and passed severe strictures and disbelieved his testimony, the police did not give him up; that he had to continue to act as a tool in their hands for the survival of his business and that lately when he declined to oblige them because he felt that his wealthy station in life and the character building stage of his children warranted giving up the profession of stock witness, the police avenged themselves by threatening externment which would inflict mortal economic injury to him if the threat was carried out.
The Assistant Commissioner of Police in reply had stated that before the externment order was passed witnesses had been examined in camera in support and in opposition of the allegations justifying externment and that on a consideration of the materials placed before the Deputy Commissioner of Police, including the education of his children and the assurance given by the petitioner, final order had been passed directing him to show good conduct for a period of 3 months.
Allowing the petition, ^ HELD: The permits externment provided the action is bona fide.
All power, including police power, must be informed by fairness, if it is to survice judicial scrutiny.
Mala fides is fatal if it is made out.
[1164 D E] 1263 Sections 47 and 50 of the Act have to be read strictly; any police apprehension is not enough; some ground or other is not adequate; there must be a clear and present danger based upon credible material which makes the movements and acts of the person in question alarming or dangerous or fraught with violence.
Like wise there must be sufficient reason to believe that the person proceeded against is so dangerous that his mere presence in Delhi or any part thereof is hazardous to the community and its safety.
A stringent test must be applied by Courts in order that this power is not abused to the detriment of the citizen Natural justice must be fairly complied with and vague allegations such as those levelled against the petitioner and secret hearings are gross violations of Articles 14, 19 and 21.
