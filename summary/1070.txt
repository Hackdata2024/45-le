The jhalawar State Bank was originally a Bank belonging to the ruling State of jhalawar and its assets, including moneys 963 due to it, became vested in the United State of Rajasthan under the covenant executed by the Ruler of Jhalawar along with other Rulers by which the United State of Rajasthan was formed.
On the promulgation of the Constitution of India, the United State of Rajasthan became the State of Rajasthan in the Indian Union and all its assets, including the jhalawar State Bank and its dues, vested in the State of Rajasthan.
Moneys due from the appellants in respect of advances made to them by the jhalawar State Bank at a time when it belonged to the ruling State of jhalawar, could be recovered by the State of Rajasthan after the Bank had become vested in it, as a public demand under the Rajasthan Public Demands Recovery Act, 1952.
The form prescribed in the Rajasthan Public Demands Recovery Act, in which a certificate has to be drawn up and filed under section 4 of the Act for commencing proceedings for recovery of public demands under the Act in so far as it required a statement as to the period for which a public demand is due, was not applicable to a public demand like a loan due to the Government in respect of which there is no question of any period for which it is due.
The Rajasthan Public Demands Recovery Act did not off end article 14 of the Constitution as giving special facility to the Government as a banker for the recovery of the bank 's dues for, the Government can legitimately be put in a separate class for this purpose.
