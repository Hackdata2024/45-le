Section 30(3)(a) of the Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Act, 1951, authorised the Controller to select any Government, local authority, public institution, officer of a government, local authority or public institution or any other person as a tenant of a vacant house.
Under the Act the owner was bound to let the house to the tenant so selected.
The petitioner was the owner of a house for whom the controller selected a tenant under these provisions.
He challenged the constitutionality of section 3(3)(a) in so far as the selection of "other persons" was authorised on the grounds that: (i) it put an unreasonable restriction on his fundamental right to property and (ii) it offended article 14 of the Constitution as it provided no guidance for choosing the tenant and enabled the controller to make an arbitrary choice.
Held, that section 3(3)(a) of the Act was valid and did not violate article 14 or 19(1)(f) of the Constitution.
An individual was a member of the public and the restriction caused by his selection was in the interest of the general public.
The restriction was not unreasonable.
It was enforced only when the owner did not want the house for his own use.
It could make no reasonable difference to him whether an individual was selected or government, local authority, public institution or any officer of any of these was selected.
The Act made provision for selection of a suitable tenant.
This was further secured by providing for an appeal to the District judge and thereafter a revision petition to the High Court.
There was ample guidance given in the Act to the Controller to choose a suitable tenant.
Every one had been given a right to apply for being selected as a tenant; and the owner bad been given the right to have his views also considered.
The ultimate decision was a judicial decision, and if required, of the highest tribunal in the State.
