Section 2(4A) (ii), Income Tax 'Act, 1922, provides that 'personal effects, that is to say, movable property (including wearing apparel, jewellery, and Furniture) held for personal use by the assessee or any member of his family dependent on him, ' shall not be included in the 'capital assets ' of the assessee.
The context in which the expression 'personal effects ' occurs and the enumeration of articles like wearing apparel, jewellery and furniture, show that only those articles are to be included as personal effects which are intimately and commonly used by the assessee.
The dictionary meaning of the expression is also the same.
Therefore, 'personal effects ' mean those items which are normally, commonly or ordinarily intended for personal use and not items which are capable of being intended for personal use.
[425E 426F 427C D] Where the assessee was in possession of a large number of gold sovereigns, silver rupee coins and silver bars, which were used at the time of the puja of deities on special religious festivals or rituals, they could not be deemed to be 'effects ' meant for Personal use.
They are capital assets and not personal effects and so, when sold, could not be excluded while computing the capital gains liable to capital gains tax under section 12B, Income Tax Act, 1922.
