The Minimum Wages Inspector of Mehsana District in Gujarat filed applications before the Minimum Wages Authority praying for directions for payment of overtime wages to four tubewell operators working in Taluka and District Panchayats on the ground that they had been made to work for more hours than what was prescribed under the .
The said Authority dismissed the applications holding that though employment in any District Panchayat or Taluka Panchayat was 'scheduled employment ' as per section 2 (g) of the Act, the tubewell operators concerned being Government servants in Panchayat Service were not entitled to claim minimum wages under the Act.
The revisions filed against the orders of the Authority were dismissed by tho High Court.
Allowing tho appeals, ^ HELD: Section 3 of the Act provides for the appropriate government fixing minimum rates of wages payable to employees employed in an employment specified in and of the Schedule.
Section 2 (i) defines 'employee ' as meaning any person who is employed for hire or reward to do any work in a 'scheduled employment '.
Section 2(g) defines 'Scheduled employment ' as meaning an employment specified in the Schedule and "Employment under any local authority" is included as item 6 of tho schedule.
[326 B G] 'Employer ' under section 2 (e) being "any person who employs whether directly or through another person, or whether on behalf of himself or any other person, one or more employees in any scheduled employment in respect of which minimum wages have been fixed under the Act" the Panchayats under which the tubewell operators concerned are employed in scheduled employment would be 'employers ' under the Act even though the tubewell operators are Government servants, for, under sub section
(2) of section 102 of the Gujarat Panchayat Act, 1961, a Secretary of a Gram Panchayat or Nagar Panchayat shall, subject to the control of the Sarpanch or Chairman, as the case may be, perform the duties mentioned in cls.
(a) (b) (c) and (d) thereof and, 323 under sub section
(3) of that section, the other servants of the Panchayats shall perform such functions and duties and exercise such powers under the Act as may be imposed or conferred on them by the Panchayat subject to rules, if any, made in that behalf.
Therefore, there can be no doubt that the tubewell operators concerned in these appeals, even though State Government servants, are employed in 'scheduled employment ' under the local authority or authorities and are consequently entitled to minimum wages and other benefits under the Act.[326 H, 327 A D]
