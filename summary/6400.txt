The writ petitions preferred by the appellants before the High Court were sought to be resisted by the State on the preliminary objection that they had an alternative remedy available before the Public Services Tribunal set up under the U.P. Act 17 of 1976.
The appellants took the plea that filing of a claim in the Tribunal was not an adequate alternate relief inasmuch as it did not have power to make any interim order.
The High Court declined to exercise its power under article 226 of the Constitution.
Remitting the case to the Public Services Tribunal for disposal on merits, the Court, HELD: 1.
