% The appellant and the respondent, husband and wife, were married under the Hindu Customs in February, 1961.
Disagreement and disharmony between the two ensued from the very beginning after the marriage.
The parties by and large lived together till February, 1971, and separately ever since thereafter except for a short period in 1975.
The respondent wife, as alleged by the appellant, did not like to live in the joint family and always created ugly scenes by quarrels, etc.
The appellant was forced to live separately from the joint family, but even then, according to him, the conduct of the wife continued to be the same bad.
The appellant alleged that he suffered a nervous breakdown because of her behaviour and had to be hospitalised.
He, therefore, filed a petition for a decree of divorce on the grounds of cruelty and desertion.
The trial Court granted the divorce.
On appeal by the respondent, the High Court reversed the decision of the trial Court and dismissed the petition for divorce.
A Letters Patent Appeal by the appellant was dismissed by the High Court.
The appellant appealed to this Court for relief by special leave.
Dismissing the appeal, the Court, ^ HELD: It could not be held that the respondent was behaving with the appellant in a manner which could be termed as cruelty, which entitled the appellant to get a decree of divorce.
Sometimes, the temperament of the parties may not be conducive to each other, resulting in petty quarrels, but it could not be held on the basis of any material that the ailment of the appellant was the direct result of the respondent 's conduct.
The High Court was right in coming to the conclusion that there was no material to prove that the respondent treated the appellant with such a cruelty as would entitle the appellant to a decree of divorce.
The judgment of the High Court maintained.
