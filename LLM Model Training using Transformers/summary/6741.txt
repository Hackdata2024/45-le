Some intervention applications, opposing the Writ Petition, and some other Writ Petitions more of less endorsing the Government 's stand raising the question as to whether the motion in question survived the dissolution of the Lok Sabha or not, were also filed.
Praying for interim direction, which was identical with the prayer in main Writ Petition, it was urged on behalf of the Petitioner Committee that having regard to the dire need of maintaining public confidence in the institution and its reputation as apex Court, it was necessary that the concerned Judge should abstain from discharging judicial functions during the pendnecy of the enquiry, and a direction should be issued accordingly, or pending disposal of the Writ Petition, the Union Government should be directed to afford all necessary facilities to the Committee for smooth and efficient functioning.
Directing expeditious hearing of the Writ Petition and connected matters, this Court, 742 HELD: 1.1 Having regard to the nature and importance of the issues involved, it is appropriate that the main matter along with the connected writ petitions is heard as expeditiously as possible.
Accordingly, this matter should be listed on July 9, 1991 and hearing of the matters proceeded with day to day until conclusion.
[744D] 1.2 In the circumstances, it is not appropriate to embark upon an examination of the prayer for interlocutory relief.
However, the Court 's disinclination to issue any interlocutory orders at this stage should not be construed as an expression of opinion on the merits of the issues either way and as an interdiction of the functioning of the Committee, if the Committee otherwise considers appropriate to proceed with the matter.
