The appellant was charged under section 304 A of Indian Penal Code for causing the death of a woman.
The deceased was residing near the house of the accused.
The wall of the latrine of the house of the deceased had fallen down about a week prior to the day of occurrence and so the deceased along with others started using the latrine of the accused.
The accused protested against their coming there.
The oral warnings however, proved ineffective and so he fixed up a naked copper wire across the passage leading upto his latrine and that wire carried current from the electrical wiring of his home to which it was connected.
On the day of the occurrence, the deceased went to the latrine of the appellant and there she touched the aforesaid fixed wire as a result of which she died soon after.
The trial and the appellate court convicted and sentenced the appellant under section 304A of the Indian Penal Code.
Hence this appeal.
200 Held : (1) The plea of the right of private defence of property was not sustainable for the reason that the type of injury caused by the trap laid by the accused could not be brought within the purview of section 99 or 103 of the Indian Penal Code.
(2) A trespasser was not an outlaw, a caput lupinem.
The mere fact that the person entering a land was a trespasser did not entitle the owner or occupier to inflict on him personal injury by direct violence and the same principle would govern the infliction of injury by indirectly doing something on the land the effect of which he must know was likely to cause serious injury to the trespasser.
