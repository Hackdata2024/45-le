One R executed a mortgage of his share in two survey Nos.
to a Cooperative Society.
On his application and in order to enable him to repay a sum of Rs. 500/ , the Society released the property in 1933, but R never paid the amount to the Society.
The Society filed an application for a mortgage award on April 5, 1934 and the Assistant Registrar made an award in the nature of a preliminary decree, on December 16, 1934.
Thereafter a final mortgage decree was passed by the Assistant Registrar and the two survey nos.
were brought to sale and purchased by the.
Society and possession was obtained on July 20, 1937.
Meanwhile, one D obtained attachment before judgment of the two survey nos., as the property of R, in a suit for money against R, and, in execution of the money decree, purchased the two survey nos.
on August 13, 1934.
In 1943, the Society went into liquidation and the liquidator sold the properties of the Society and the appellant bought the two.
survey nos.
He filed a suit for a declaration of his title and possession of the properties in the two, survey nos.
from various persons who were in possession of the properties under R and D.
The High Court dismissed the .suit.
In appeal to this Court, HELD: (1) The motive of the release, in 1933, of the properties by the Society in favour of R was the payment of Rs. 500/ by R to the Society, but it was not a condition Of the release.
Therefore, the release was binding on the Society.
[209 D E] (2) But R did not object to the inclusion of the items in the mortgage award.
Therefore, the Society must have bona fide felt that the properties remained encumbered.
[211 G] (3) The proceedings in respect of the mortgage were pending from April 5, 1934 to July 20, 1937.
The proceedings were for obtaining a mortgage award equivalent to a mortgage decree and not for a money decree.
The fact that they were attached before judgment in D 's suit does not affect the application of the doctrine of lis pendens.
Attachment is only effective in preventing alienation and does not create title to property.
If in fact, the property was.
acquired pendente lite, the acquirer is bound by the decree ultimately obtained.
Therefore, D 's purchase on August 13, 1934, was hit by the. doctrine.
of lis pendens in section 52 of the .
Since D 's purchase was hit by the doctrine the properties continued to be those of the Society and hence, the appellant was entitled to them.
