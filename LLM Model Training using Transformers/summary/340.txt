The petitioner was employed by the Government of India on a five year contract in the Resettlement and Employment Directorate of the Ministry of Labour.
When his contract was due to expire the Government made him a new offer to continue him in service in his post temporarily for the period of the Resettlement and Employment Organisation on the condition that he will be governed by the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1949, which provided for termination of the contract by month 's notice on either side.
He accepted the offer and continued in service, but subsequently his services were terminated after giving him one month 's notice, The petitioner applied for relief under article 32 (1) of the Constitution alleging that his funda mental rights under articles 311, 14 and 16 (1) of the Constitution were infringed: Held, (i) that article 311 had no application as this was not a case of dismissal or removal from service nor a reduction in rank but only an ordinary case of a contract being terminated by notice under one of its clauses, the difference between dismissal and 656 removal being that the former ordinarily disqualifies from future employment but not the latter; (ii) article 14 had no application as he had not been discriminated against and had not been denied the protection of any laws which others similarly situated could claim; (iii) article 16 was equally inapplicable as the petitioner was not denied equal opportunity in a matter relating to appointment or employment but had been treated just like any other person to whom an offer of temporary employment under these conditions was made.
The State can enter into contracts of temporary employment and impose special terms in each case, provided they are not inconsistent with the Constitution, and those who choose to accept those terms and enter into the contract are bound by them, even as the State is bound.
