The respondents were employed as lecturers and teachers in the various Municipal Higher Secondary Schools run and managed by a Municipal Council in the State.
The State Government transferred certain lecturers and teachers serving under a particular Municipal Council to the Schools run and managed by another Municipal Council.
The respondents writ petition challenging the order of their transfers was allowed by the High Court on the ground that no officer other than those mentioned in section 94(7) namely Revenue Officer, Accounts Officer etc.
could be transferred.
In the State 's appeal the respondents contended that they were employees of schools run and managed by Municipal Councils but not of the Councils.
^ HELD: 1.
The High Court was not right in putting a restricted interpretation on section 94(7) of the Act.
The other officers and servants who can be appointed by the Municipal Councils under sub section (1) or sub section (2) of Section 97 are also officers and servants mentioned in these sub sections for the purposes of sub section (7).
Theoretically, therefore, the power does exist in the State Government to transfer them.
[788 B C] 2.
The argument that the respondents are the employees of schools run and managed by the Municipal Councils but not of the councils themselves has no substance.
Education department is one of the departments of a Municipal Council.
Section 124 envisages the establishment and running of Higher Secondary Schools by Municipal Councils and therefore the lecturers and teachers appointed in the various schools are officers and servants of the Municipal Councils.
[788 G H, 789 A] 3.
In case of employees getting small emoluments the power to transfer should be sparingly exercised under some compelling exigencies of a particular situation and not as a matter of routine.
