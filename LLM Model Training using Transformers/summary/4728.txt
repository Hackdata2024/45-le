The appellants being mother and son of one Jagmohan Swarup who was governed by the and who died intestate on June 15, 1967 filed Civil Suit No. 122 of 1970 on the file of the first Additional Civil Judge, Dehradun for a declaration to the effect that they were together entitled to 2/3rd share of the amount due and payable under the insurance policies though the deceased assured has nominated the respondent his widow as the person to whom the amounts were payable.
The respondent contested the suit claiming that she has the absolute right to the amounts to the exclusion of her son and her mother in law.
The suit was dismissed.
The First Appeal before the Dt.
Judge, Dehradun and the Second Appeal before the High Court were dismissed.
Hence the appeal after obtaining special leave of the Court.
Allowing the appeal, the Court, ^ HELD: 1.1 A mere nomination made under Section 39 of the does not have the effect of conferring on the nominee any beneficial interest in the amount payable under the life insurance policy on the death of the accused.
The nomination only indicates the hand which is authorised to receive the amount, on the payment of which the insurer gets a valid discharge of its liability under the policy.
The amount, however, can be claimed by the heirs of the assured in accordance with the law of succession governing them.
[1009G, 1004 B D] 1.2 An analysis of the provisions of Section 39 of the Act clearly established that the policy holder continues to hold interest in the policy during his life time and the nominee acquires no sort of interest in the policy during the life time of the holder.
If that is so, on the death of the policyholder the amount payable under the policy becomes part of his estate which is governed by the law of succession applicable to him.
such succession may be testamentary or intestate.
The tenuous character of the right of a nominee becomes more pronounced when one contrasts the provisions of Section 39 with that of 993 Section 38.
Section 39 of the Act was not intended to act as a third mode of succession provided by the stature and incorrectly styled as "statutory testament" by the Delhi High Court.
[998 C E] 1.3 The language of Section 39 of the Act is neither capable of altering the course of succession under law nor can be said to have equated a nominee to an heir or legatee.
