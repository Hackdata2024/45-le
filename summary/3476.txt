Under section 12(5) read with 10(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, if on consideration of a failure report u/s 12(4) from the conciliation officer, the appropriate Government is satisfied and is of opinion that there is an industrial dispute and a case for reference, it may make such reference to the labour court.
On considering the "failure report", of the conciliation proceedings in respect of the appellant, an Electrical foreman, the respondent state informed him that his duties being supervisory with wages more than Rs. 500/ his case was not covered by the definition of the terms "workman" under the Industrial Disputes Act and therefore, not a fit case for adjudication.
The appellant assailed the said orders under Art.226, which was dismissed.
On appeal by special leave the appellant contended that the question whether an employee is a workman or not was a disputed question of fact and law and, therefore could only be decided by a labour court and on a reference only but not by the State Government while exercising its powers u/s 12(5).
Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: (1) The order of the Government acting under section 10(1) read with section 12(5) of the Industrial Disputes Act passed after subjective satisfaction is an administrative order and not a judicial or a quasi judicial one.
