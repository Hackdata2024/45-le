'A ', a partner in a firm running a sugar factory, insti tuted a suit for its dissolution in 1948 and a Receiver was appointed by the Court.
The arrangement arrived at for the factory was that it would be leased out for a term of five years to the highest bidder from amongst the six partners.
In July, 1948, 'A ' transferred his 1/6th share to the appel lant for Rs.4,50,000.
The appellant had taken a loan against shares of that value held by him in another sugar mill for purchase of the share.
In May, 1950, another partner 'B ' leased out his 1/6th share to the appellant on an annual payment of Rs.50,000.
In July, 1950 yet another partner 'C ' leased out his 1/6th share to the appellant for a similar sum.
In 1951 'C ' sued for cancellation of the lease.
In April, 1954 the dispute was compromised and the lease termi nated. 'C ' undertook to pay the appellant at the rate of Rs. 16,000 for the first three years and at the rate of Rs. I0,000 for the subsequent two years. 'B 's 1/6th share was also returned on mutual arrangement and he agreed to pay the appellant a sum of Rs.39,000 and odd annually.
During the assessment proceedings for the year 1953 54 the nature of these receipts came to be considered.
The assessee appellant maintained that these were in the nature of capital receipts in lieu of the lease hold interest.
The assessee also claimed depreciation on the 1/6th share in the sugar mill that he had acquired from 'A '.
Similar questions also arose for the assessment years 1954 55 and 1955 56.
The assessee had suffered a loss in the sugar business in the assessment year 1953 54, a part of which remained unab sorbed, and claimed set off of that unabsorbed loss against the share of the rent received by him from the Receiver in the assessment year 1954 55.
Since the sugar mill was being assessed as an association of persons, for the assessment year 1960 61 102 the Receiver claimed that for the purpose of computing depreciation allowance, the written down value of the busi ness assets be enhanced so as to reflect the sum of Rs.4,50,000 in place of 16th share representing the share of 'A '.
The Revenue negatived the assessee 's contentions, which view was upheld by the High Court.
Dismissing the appeals by certificate, the Court, HELD: 1.
The amounts the assessee received under the compromise or by amicable arrangement from other partners were in the nature of profits to be received by the assessee for the interest held in the business and, therefore, con stituted taxable income.
[106B] 2.
The benefit of section 10(2)(vi) of the Income tax Act, 1922 would be admissible only where the assessee is the owner of the property.
It too is not admissible in respect of a fractional claim.
[106A] In the instant case, all that is claimed for the asses see is 1/6th share in the machinery.
Such a fractional share does not suffice for granting an allowance for depreciation under section 10(2)(vi) of the Act.
[105F] 3.
Two conditions had to be fulfilled under section 24 of the Incometax Act, 1922 before the claim for set off of carried forward loss could be admitted, firstly, the income against which the loss has to be set off should be income from business and secondly, the business should be same in which the loss was suffered.
[107C] In the instant case, the letting out of the sugar mill was not the business of the assessee.
The Receiver was appointed for dissolution of the firm and the main reason for allowing the sugar factory to work was to dispose it of as a running mill so that proper price could be fetched.
[107DE] 4.
Under the scheme of 1922 Act, it is the assessee who alone is entitled to maintain claim of depreciation.
Within the framework of that scheme it is difficult to maintain separate value of a part of the asset to work out deprecia tion.
The book value, as shown must in the instant case, therefore, be applicable to the entire assets of the firm including the 1/6th share which 'A ' had given to the appel lant.
The claim of the Receiver for depreciation cannot, therefore, be sustained.
