The election of the appellant as a member of the Bihar State Assembly was challenged under section 7(d) of the Representation of the People Act, 951, by the first respondent who was also a candidate for election for the same constituency, on the ground that at the date of the nomination the appellant had an interest in contracts for execution of works undertaken by the Bihar Government, and that his nomination had been improperly accepted.
The appellant 's plea inter alia was that he had executed the contracts not in his individual capacity but as the Mukhiya of the Village Panchayat and therefore the disqualification imposed by section 7(d) of the Act could not be invoked against him.
The contracts in question related to community projects undertaken in pursuance of the Second Five Year Plan, under which the execution of different works adopted under the plan was to be by popular local agencies like Village Panchayats.
The contracts were all in the prescribed form and the appellant, at the com 536 mencement of the contract, described himself by his name, stating that he belonged to the village.
The preamble to the contract showed that the appellant undertook to carry out the construction of the development project under local works programme mentioned in the contract as per estimate attached thereto, that he agreed to execute the work.
according to and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein and that he undertook to contribute 50% of the cost in cash and labour.
At the end of the contract he signed as Mukhiya, giving his address as the Gram Panchayat.
The Election Tribunal found in favour of the appellant and dismissed the election petition, but, on appeal, the High Court took the view (1) that the description of the appellant given by him at the time when he signed the contracts was not a term of the contract and could not therefore support his plea that he had executed the contract as Mukhiya of the Panchayat, and (2) that the fact that he undertook liability to execute the contracts as required and to become liable for payment of any fine imposed by the local government officer in case of his default showed obligations of a personal character inconsistent with his plea.
Held, that, on a proper construction of the contracts taking into account all the terms and conditions as a whole and considering them in the light of the background of the Second Five Year Plan, when the appellant signed the contracts as the Mukhiya of the Village Panchayat he acted as its agent and not as an individual acting in his personal capacity.
