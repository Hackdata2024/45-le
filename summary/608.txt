Under section 42(2) Of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, " Where a person not resident or not ordinarily resident in the taxable territories carried on business with a person resident in the taxable territories, and it appears to the Income tax Officer that owing to the close connection between such persons the course of business is so arranged that the business done by the resident person with the person not resident or not ordinarily resident produces to the resident either no profits or less than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise in that business, the profits derived therefrom, or which may reasonably be deemed to have been derived therefrom, shall be chargeable to income tax in the name of the resident person who shall be deemed to be, for all the purposes of this Act, the assessee in respect of such income tax The appellant, a private limited company carrying on business as marine engineers and ship repairers had its registered office in Bombay and was resident and ordinarily resident in India, but its entire share capital was beneficially owned by two non resident companies whose business consisted in plying ships for hire.
Under an agreement between them the ships plied for hire by the non resident companies were to be repaired by the appellant company at cost, charging no profits.
The Income tax Officer made an assessment on the appellant company under section 42(2) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922.
It was contended for the appellant (1) that section 42(2) imposed a charge only on a business carried on by a non resident and that therefore no tax could be imposed on the business of the appellant, and (2) that it was a condition for the levy of a charge under that subsection that the non resident must carry on business with the resident and that in the instant case it was not satisfied, as all that the non resident companies did was only to get their ships repaired by the appellant company: Held, (1) that the business which is the subject matter of taxation under section 42(2) Of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, is that of the resident and not of a non resident.
The expression 849 " derived therefrom " in that sub section refers to the business of the resident.
(2)that a person can be said to carry on a business with another if the dealings between them form concerted and organised activities of a business character.
Where, as in the instant case, the nonresident companies got their ships repaired by the appellant, not as they might by any other repairer but under a special agreement that repairs should be done by the appellant at cost, the non resident companies must be held to have carried on business with the appellant within the meaning of section 42(2) Of the Act, even though the non resident companies might have derived no profits from the dealings with the appellant.
