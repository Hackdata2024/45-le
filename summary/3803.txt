The respondents in all these appeals are "extra depart mental agents" within the meaning of Rule 2(b) of the Posts and Telegraphs Extra Departmental Agents (Conduct of Service) Rules, 1964 issued under the authority of the Government of India.
They were either dismissed or removed from service during the period between January 1, 1966 and June 18, 1974, admittedly without complying with the provi sions of article 311(2) of the Constitution.
The question in each case is whether the respondent held a "civil post" as contemplated in article 311(2) of the Constitution.
The High Court of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh & Orissa held that the respondents held a civil post under the Union of India and the orders terminating their services in violation of article 31.1(2) of the Constitution were invalid.
Dismissing the appeals the Court, HELD: (1) An "extra departmental agent" held a "civil post" and his dismissal or removal would be invalid, if there was non compliance with article 311 (2) of the Constitu tion.
[680 B C. 682 E] (2) An extra departmental agent is not a casual worker, but he holds a post under the administrative control of the State.
It is apparent from the 1964 Rules that the em ployment of an extra departmental agent is in a post which exists "apart from" the person who happens to fill it at any particular time.
Though such a post is outside the regular civil service, there is no doubt it is a post under the State.
[681 E F] State of Assam & Ors.
vs Kanak Chandra Dutta ; @ 682 applied.
(3) The 1964 rules make it clear that these extra departmental agents work under the direct control and super vision of the authority who obviously have the right to control the manner in which they must carry out their du ties.
There can be no doubt, therefore, that the relation ship between the Postal Authorities and the extra departmen tal agents are of master and servant.
[662 C E] Venkataswamy vs Superintendent, Post Offices, AIR 1957 Orissa 112; V. Subbaravalu vs Superintendent of Post Offices, AIR 1961 Madras 166, held inapplicable.
