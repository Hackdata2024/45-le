In October 1946, B wrote to the Government of the erstwhile State of Gwalior stating that certain industries would be established in Gwalior if the Government gave certain facilities including exemption from taxation.
The matter was eventually put up before the Ruler who on January 18, 1949, made an order sanctioning the proposals made by the minister which.
included exemption from taxation as desired by B.
On April ' 7, 1947, an agreement was entered into between the Government and B in accordance with the order of the Ruler dated January 18, 1947, under which certain facilities and concessions were granted to B for the establishment of industries in Gwalior, which included exemption from any form of taxation on the income for a period of 12 years from the date of starting of the factories.
In pursuance of the agreement the appellant company was started and actual production began sometime in June 1949 so far as the weaving section of manufacturing, cloth from artificial silk yarn was concerned, while the staple fibre section of the company started actual working on or about February 18, 1954.
In April 1948 the Ruler of Gwalior entered into a covenant with the rulers of certain other States for the, formation of a United State called Madhya Bharat, under which the Rulers made over the administration to the Raj Pramukh.
Article VI of the Covenant provided, inter alia, that the duties.
and obligations of the Ruler pertaining or incidental to the Government of the covenanting states shall devolve on the United State and shall be discharged by it.
On December 13, 1948, the Madhya Bharat Act, No. 1 of 1948, was passed which, provided, inter alia, that all laws of the covenanting states.
shall continue to remain in force until repealed or amended.
On January 26, 1950, the Constitution of India came into force and the State of Madhya Bharat became a Part B State under the Constitution.
On April 1, 1950, the Indian Income tax Act,. 1922, was extended to the Part B State of Madhya Bharat, and, from the same date Finance Act, 1950, also became applicable, to that State.
The effect of section 13 of the Act of 1950 was to repeal all laws relating to income tax prevailing in those parts of India to which the Indian Income tax Act was extended.
On February 25, 1950, an agreement was entered into between the President of India and the State of Madhya Bharat, which was to be in force for a period of ten years under which certain recommendations of Indian States Finances Enquiry Committee were accepted.
The Government of India also issued the Part 893 B States (Taxation Concessions) Order, 1950, by cl. 16 of which, certain concessions were given to industrial undertakings which had been granted exemption from income tax by the Ruler of an Indian State.
In December 1950, the company applied under cl. 16 of the Concessions Order for an exemption from payment of income tax for the full period of twelve years as provided in the agreement dated April 7, 1947, but the Government of India decided to exempt the company from incometax and super tax for the assessment years 1950 51 to 1954 55 in respect of the weaving section and rejected the claim for exemption of the staple fibre section which began working in April 1954.
On November 23, 1956, the company filed a suit against the Union of India for a declaration that under the agreement dated April 7, 1947, it was entitled to exemption from income tax and super tax for a period of 12 years from June 1949 with respect to the weaving section and for a period of 12 years from February 1954 with respect to the staple fibre section of the company.
The company also filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh for the same reliefs.
Held:(i) The order of January 18, 1947, was not a law by which the Ruler of Gwalior granted exemption from income tax to the company to be established.
It only amounted to a signification of the Ruler 's acceptance of the request for concessions made by B and an order to his officers to proceed further in the matter after the signification of the Ruler 's acceptance of the request.
(ii)In finding out whether a particular order of a Ruler continued under article 372 of the Constitution of India as law, the jurisprudential distinction between legislative, judicial and executive acts had to be considered; and only those orders of the Ruler which were jurisprudentially legislative acts would continue as laws under article 372.
(iii)The fact that the obligation of the Ruler of Gwalior under the agreement of April 7, 1947, devolved on the Government of India eventually by virtue of article 295(l)(b), did not take away the power of Parliament to pass a valid law within its competence which did not transgress the constitutional limitations, and which might affect the obligation arising out of the agreement of April 7, 1947, and even completely supersede it.
(iv)After the extension of the Indian Income tax Act to Part B State of Madhya Bharat and the passing of the Finance Act, 1950, the exemption claimed by the company under the agreement of April 7, 1947, must fall and the company would only be entitled to (i) reduction in rates provided by the Concessions Order and (ii) such exemption or concessions as the Central Government might grant under cl. 16 of the Concessions Order.
(v)Art.
278(l)(a) merely contemplated an agreement between the Centre and Part B States with respect to levy, collec tion and distribution of public revenues which were leviable by the Government of India and had nothing to do with any contract between a former Indian State and another person with respect to such revenues which might have become the obligation of the Government of India under article 295(1)(b) 894 (vi)The Agreement of February 25, 1950, with respect to concessions to corporations must be deemed to have been en tered under article 295(l)(b) and not under article 278(l)(a) and, hence, the company could not rely on that agreement and con tend that the agreement of April 7, 1947, was binding for at least ten years thereunder.
