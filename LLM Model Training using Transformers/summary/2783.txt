In a petition under article 32 for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus, HELD : The incidents were not interlinked and could not have prejudiced the maintenance of public order.

the petitioner was entitled to be released.
The power to detain is an exceptional power to be used in exceptional circumstances and cannot be used as a convenient substitute for the ordinary process of law.
