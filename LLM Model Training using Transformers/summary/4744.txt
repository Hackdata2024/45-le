The first respondent, Tej Singh, won in legislative assembly election defeating the appellant by 123 votes and also 3 other candidates including Ruplal.
The appellant challenged the election of Tej Singh on the ground that he was guilty of committing corrupt practices.
The main corrupt practice said to have been indulged in by Tej Singh was that he had got circulated pamphlets and posters among the voters of the constituency wherein he had mentioned that Ruplal had withdrawn his candidature and any vote given to him (Tej Singh) would be deemed to be a vote for Ruplal, and the said posters were printed not by Ruplal but at the instance of Tej Singh.
Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD .
The effect of the posters was to mislead the voters so as to make them believe that one of the candidates, viz., Ruplal, had withdrawn and any vote given to Tej Singh would be considered as a vote given to Ruplal.
in other words the effect of the posters was that the voters who would have voted for Ruplal would now cast their votes in favour of Tej Singh.
As the margin of votes between the defeated and the returned candidates was very small, viz., 123 votes, if such a misrepresentation was not made, in all probability the votes would have gone to the appellant (Avtar Singh) and, therefore, the result of the election would have been materially altered.
On a perusal of the evidence both oral and documentary adduced by the parties and in the circumstances of the case, the irresistible inference and inescapable conclusion that can be arrived at is that Tej Singh had actually paid for the posters which were printed at his instance and Ruplal was not connected p with the printing of the posters.
In these circumstances the appellant has proved beyond reasonable doubt that Tej Singh had indulged in corrupt practices particularly when the printing of the posters by Tej Singh has been clearly admitted by him.
