The appellant K claimed certain property alleging that he had purchased it from one A, who had purchased it benami in the name of one H, and H in turn had sold it to S the respondent.
Held: (i) The protection available by section 66 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not only against the certified purchaser but also against anyone claiming through him and section 66 bars the claim.
The second sub section refer to the claims of creditors and not of transferees, which is dealt with in the first sub section.
(ii) If the possession of the real owner ripens into title under the Limitation Act and he is dispossessed, he can sue to obtain possession, for he does not then rely on the benami nature of the transaction.
But the alternative claim must be clearly made and proved.
Adverse possession must be adequate in continuity, in publicity and extent and a plea is required at the least to show when possession becomes adverse so that the starting point of limitation against the party affected can be found.
