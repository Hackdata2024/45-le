The complainant lodged a complaint to the police of a conspiracy to cheat and defraud him.
That report did not mention the respondent 's name, because, it was the case of the prosecution itself that the respondent appeared on the scene only subsequent to the lodging of the report.
The part attributed to him was that he was present along with the person complained against when the latter came to the complainant to demand money.
That circumstance alone would not warrant the inference that the respondent was also a party to any conspiracy to defraud or cheat the complainant.
The High Court was, therefore, right in quashing the charges framed against the respondent.
