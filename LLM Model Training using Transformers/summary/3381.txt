The resondent filed a suit against the Union of India alleging that due to negligence of the railways a consignment of tobacco despatched by him to Gaya was substituted in transit and that in its place inferior tobacco was delivered at Gaya.
The railways on the other hand alleged fraud and collusion between the respondent and his father, also a bidi tobacco merchant in Gujarat, because by deliberate manipulation, the respondent consigned inferior goods to Gaya and superior goods to Gujarat.
The trial court dismissed the respondent 's suit.
The High Court allowed the suit for damages but refused refund of excise duty said to have been paid by the respondent.
Dismissing the appeal to this Court, ^ HELD: (1) The appellant had not been able to make out a case of fraud.
The High Court was justified in negativing the plea of fraud and in decreeing the suit.
[904 FG] (2) Fraud, like any other charge of criminal offence, whether made in civil or criminal proceedings must be established beyond reasonable doubt.
However suspicious may be the circumstances, however strange the coincidences and however grave the doubts, suspicion alone can never take the place of proof.
[904 FG] A. L. N. Narayanan Chettyar vs Official Assignee, High Court Rangoon, A.I.R. 1941 P.C. 93, referred to.
In the instant case there is absolutely no evidence to show any prior meeting of the minds between the respondent and his father before the consignment was sent either to Gujarat or Gaya so as to raise an inference that these two persons had hatched up a conspiracy in order to defraud the appellant.
