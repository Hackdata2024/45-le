The first appellant No. 1 sent a consignment of mustard oil in a tank wagon from Firozabad, U. P. to itself at Calcutta where it took delivery of the wagon from the railway authorities.
The Food Inspector took samples of the oil from the wagon which on analysis were found to be adulterated.
The appellants were prosecuted under section 462 of the Calcutta Municipal Act, 951 for storing adulterated mustard oil for sale.
The 665 appellants contended that the presumption under sub section
(4) of section 462 that the mustard oil was stored for sale was rebutted in view of certain arrangements between the U. P. Oil Millers Association and the Deputy Commissioner of Police and of a letter written by the appellants to the Association asking that a sample may be taken and tested so that the appellants "may take the delivery of oil only if it is found pure on analysis.
" Held, that this was not sufficient to rebut the presumption '.
that the oil was stored for sale.
The letter did not say that the oil would not be sold; it was not stated as to what would be done if the oil was found to be impure.
There was no arrangement between the Association and the Corporation which was the sole authority to take action.
The arrangement and the letter were a device to make detection difficult.
