By section 97(1)(c) of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946: "A strike shall be illegal if it is commenced or continued only for the reason that the employer has not carried out the provisions of any standing order or has made an illegal change".
The management of the appellant Mill desiring to make a change in the existing system of working started making an experiment by asking a few workmen who had volunteered to work at the rate of four looms to a weaver for a period of two months.
The other workers objected that this was an illegal change on the ground that the management could not legally introduce any change without first going through the procedure prescribed by the Act, and went on strike.
The question was whether the strike was illegal.
Held, that as the workmen had gone on strike only for the reason that the change or experiment made by the appellant was an illegal change, their action came within the express terms of B. 97(1)(c) of the Act and the strike was illegal.
