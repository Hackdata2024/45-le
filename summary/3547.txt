Section 84 of Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963 declares that all voluntary transfers of land effected after the publication of the Kerala Land Reforms Bill on September 15, 1963, shall be null and void.
Clause (ii) of this section while provided an exemption in respect of transfers made on account of "natural love and affection" was omitted in 1972 with retrospective effect from August 16, 19 '68.
Section 81(1)(1) exempts kayal padasakharams of Kuttanad area from the restrictions on ownership prescribed.by Chapter III of the Act.
By an amendment of 1969, this exemption was with drawn; but the amending section was not brought into force until January 1, 1970.
There were two sets of petitions before the High Court.
In one set the High Court held that (1) voluntary transfers of kayal lands effected between September 15, 1963 and January 1, 1970, were lawful and valid, and in the other (2) that certain transfers by way of gift were invalid.
In the first set of appeals to this Court the State contended that the 1969 amendment should be given retrospec tive effect from April 1, 1964 i.e., the date on which section 84 was brought into force and in the second set the donees contended that the transfers were saved because they were effected on account of natural love and affection.
Dismissing all the appeals, HELD: (1)(a) Even though by virtue of section 84 all volun tary transfers effected after September 15, 1963 were invalid, transfers made in respect of kayal lands could not be held to be invalid because they were exempt from the provisions of Chapter Iii.
Though that exemption was with drawn in 1969, that amendment was not brought into force until January 1, 1970, Voluntary transfers made between September 15, 1963 and January 1, 1970 were therefore valid.
[278 B C] (b) The 1969 amendment was neither curative nor declara tory of the previous law.
It merely omitted cl.
(1) from section 81.
A statute is not to be read retrospectively except of necessity.
There; is no such necessity in the instant cases, for the legislature decided to exempt kayal lands from the operation of the restrictions, and the 1969 amend ment withdrawing the exemption was not brought into force until January 1, 1970. [278 E F] Pritam Singh Chahil vs State of Punjab and others; , and Channan Singh and another vs Jai Kaur ; held inapplicable.
(2) In the other set of cases the impugned transfers were in favour of the donor 's grand children by his daugh ter, who was alive and were effected between January 1, 1970 and November 2, 1972.
It was held that it was futile to contend that section 84 would not be attracted to the transfers on the ground that they were effected on account of natural love and affection within the meaning of the exemption provided by section 84, because the exemption was taken away by Act 17 of 1972 which specifically stated that, that clause shall be, and shall be deemed to have been omitted with effect from the 16th August, 1968" and they could not be said to fall within the exempted category because of the amendment made in section 84 in 1972 restricting the exemption to gifts made in favour of a donor 's son or daughter or the son of a daughter of his predeceased son or daughter.
