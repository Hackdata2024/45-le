The prosecution alleged that the petitioner, an Assistant Sub Inspector of Police, subjected one of the suspects in a theft case to severe flagellation which resulted in the death of the suspect.
Medical examination of the deceased revealed that death was due to asphyxiation.
On a study of the circumstances and the incontrovertible facts of flagellation and asphyxiation within police premises and the testimony of eye witnesses, the trial court found the petitioner guilty of the offence with which he was charged and sentenced him to imprisonment for life.
His explanation that death was due to suicidal hanging was rejected by the trial court as well as by the High Court.
Dismissing the petition, ^ HELD: There was no error either in the appreciation of evidence or the conclusion reached by the courts below.
[278 D] [It is disturbing to find diabolical recurrence of police tortures resulting in a terrible scare in the minds of common citizens that their lives and liberty are under a new peril when the guardians of the law gore human rights to death.
Police lock ups are becoming more and more awesome cells.
This development is disastrous to the human rights awareness and the humanist constitutional order.] [278 E]
