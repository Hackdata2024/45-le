% The Governor of Maharashtra by a notification dated 18th September, 1987, issued under section 16 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 ( 'the Act ') called upon six local authorities Constituencies in the State of Maharashtra to elect one member from each of the said constituencies to fill the vacancies in the Maharashtra Legislature Council.
On the same day, the Election Commission of India, the appellant, issued a notification under section 30 of the Act fixing the calendar of events for the purpose of holding the elections.
Osmanabadcum Latur Beed Local Authorities constituency was one of the said six constituencies.
Under the notification of the Election Commission, the last date for the withdrawal of the candidatures was 28th September, 1987 and the poll, if necessary, was to be taken on the 18th October, 1987 and the entire election process was to be completed within 21st October, 1987.
Respondents 1 to 5 filed a writ petition in High Court challenging the validity of the notification issued by Election Commission on 18th September 1987, on the ground that the notification was invalid because the Zilla Parishad of Osmanabad and Latur districts which were within the constituency had not been constituted and the Administrators were appointed to run the said Zilla Parishads and, therefore, the members of the Zilla Parishads who were entitled to take part in the said elections had been deprived of their right to participate in the said election.
Along with the writ petition, an application was made praying for the postponement of the last date of withdrawal of the candidates from 28th September, 1987 to 1st October, 1987.
A Single Judge of the High Court passed an order on September 26, 1987, issuing notice on the writ petition and passing an interim order ex parte directing the postponement of last date of withdrawal of the candidatures from 28th September, 1987 to October 1, 1987.
On October 1. 1987.
a Division Bench of 879 the High Court dismissed the writ petition.
The High Court did not take any observation as to the effect of the interim order passed by it earlier on the election programme.
18 Candidates withdrew their candidature by 1st October, 1987, the last date for withdrawal of candidatures as per the interim order passed by the High Court.
In the circumstances, the Election Commission postponed the date of poll from 18th October, 1987 (as originally notified) to 18th November, 1987, in compliance with the spirit underlying section 30(d) of the Act, which contemplated an interval of 20 days between the last date for withdrawal of candidatures and the date of poll and notified the change of the date of poll in the official Gazette.
It also notified 4th November, 1987 as the date before which the election had to be completed instead of 21st October, 1987, originally fixed.
On 16 l0 1987, the respondents 1 to 5 filed a review petition before the High Court, seeking a direction that the election programme might be renotified on the ground that clear 20 days ' interval was not there between the last date of withdrawal of candidatures and the date of poll originally fixed, viz. 18th October, 1987.
The High Court on 16th October 1987, passed an order adjourning the case to October 26, 1987 and staying the election fixed for the 18th October, 1987 till it passed further order on 26th October 1987, even though it was brought to the notice of the High Court that the Election Commission had on 16.10.1987 already postponed the date of poll from 18th October, 1987 to 1st November, 1987.
Aggrieved by the interim order in the writ petition postponing the last date of withdrawal of the candidatures from 28th September, 1987, to October 1, 1987 and by the interim order passed on October 16, 1987 in the Review Petition, the Election Commission appealed to this Court for relief by special leave.
Allowing the appeal, the Court, ^ HELD: A dispute regarding election to the Legislative Council of a State can be raised only under the provisions contained in Part VI of the Act.
Section 80 A of the Act provides that the Court having jurisdiction to try on election petition shall be the High Court.
In view of the non obstante clause contained in Article 329 of the Constitution, the power of the High Court to entertain a petition questioning an election on whetever grounds under Article 226 of the Constitution is taken away.
If there was any ground relating to the non compliance with the provisions of the Act and the Constitution on which the validity of any election process could be questioned, the person interested in question 880 ing the election has to wait till the election is over and institute a petition in accordance with section 81 of the Act calling in question the election of the successful candidate within forty five days from the date of election of the returned candidate but not earlier than the date of election.
The High Court even though it had issued an interim order in the writ petition on 26.9.1987 postponing the last date for withdrawal of the 13 candidatures to 1st October, 1987, dismissed the petition by its judgment dated 1.10.1987.
Having dismissed the petition on 1.10.1987, the High Court committed a serious error in entertaining a review petition in the very same writ petition on 16.
10.1987 and passing an order staying the election which had been earlier fixed for 18.10.87 till further orders "looking to the mandatory provisions of section 30 of Representation of the People Act.
" The High Court failed to recall to its mind that it was not its concern under Article 226 of the Constitution to rectify any error even if there was an error committed in the process of election at any stage prior to the declaration of the result of the election notwithstanding the fact that the error in question related to a mandatory provision of the statute relating to the conduct of the election.
If there was any such error committed in the course of the election process, the Election Commission had the authority to set it right by virtue of power vested in it under Article 324 of the Constitution as decided in Mohinder Singh Gill & Anr.
vs The Chief Election Commisioner, New Delhi & Ors., , and to see that the election process was completed in a fair manner.
[886A B, G H; 887E H] In this case, 75% of the total electorate (including the number of members of the Zilla Parishads of Osmanabad and Latur districts who would have been voters had the said Zilla Parishads been constituted) were entitled to vote.
Since the existing position in the constituency satisfied the guideline prescribed by the Election Commission, the election from the said constituency had been ordered.
It was only on account of the interim order passed by the High Court on 26.9.1987 postponing last date for withdrawal of the candidatures from 28.9.1987 to 1.10.1987 and not on account of any mistake committed by the Election Commission that the interval between the last date of withdrawal and the date of poll, originally fixed as 18.10.1987 fell short of the period of twenty days prescribed by clause (d) of section 30 of the Act.
After the judgment of the High Court was pronounced dismissing the writ petition on 1.10.1987, in order to ensure that there was an interval of 20 days between the last date for withdrawal of candidatures and the date of poll, the Election Commission had on its own postponed the date of poll on 1.11.1987 and published a notification in the official Gazette even before the Court passed another interim order on 16.10.1987 in 881 the Review Petition.
All these changes in the calendar of events of the election came about because of the earlier interim order of the High Court.
It is not the law that every non compliance with the provisions of the Act or the Constitution will vitiate an election.
It is only when it is shown that the result of the election was materially affected by such non compliance that the High Court would have the jurisdiction to set aside an election in accordance with section 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Act.
[888C G] The High Court grievously erred in entertaining the review petition and passing an interim order on 16.10.1987.
Both the interim orders the one passed on 26.9.1987 postponing the last date of withdrawal of the candidatures, and the other, passed on 16.10.1987 were without jurisdiction.
There was hardly any justification for entertaining the review petition in the circumstances of the case and issuing notice thereon particularly after the High Court itself had rejected the writ petition on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to interfere with the process of election at that stage in view of the provisions of Article 329(b) of the Constitution.
The Review Petition before the High Court was liable to be dismissed.
The entire proceedings in the High Court amounted to a clear abuse of the process of law.
[889B D] OBSERVATION: The success of democracy is dependent upon the cooperation of the Legislature, the press, the political parties and above all the citizenry, and each of them discharging the duties assigned to it.
Every member of the body politic should play his legitimate role for the success of the democracy.
Some times, the success of democracy also depends upon the observance of restraint on the part of the Constitutional functionaries.
