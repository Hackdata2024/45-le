Certain disputes between the appellant and its workmen were referred to the industrial tribunal for adjudication by the State Government under the provisions of the .
The award made by the tribunal provided, inter alia, (1) that if a workman had to work on a weekly off or on a holiday he should be paid 1 1/2 times his wages and dearness allowance over and above a substituted holiday, and (2) that all the workmen shall be granted 15 days privilege leave in a year which could be allowed to be accumulated up to 45 days.
The appellant applied to the Government under section 36A of the Act stating that the directions given by the tribunal had to be clarified on the grounds, inter alia, (1) that the reason for directing the additional payment for working on a weekly off or on a holiday was that the workman was deprived of an opportunity to spend his time in the company of his colleagues and refresh himself, but that there was no basis for this since the whole factory worked on weekly off or on a holiday, and (2) that the accumulation of privilege leave of 45 days to all workmen was not justified.
The tribunal made a clarification as regards privilege leave confining it to only those workmen who had put in 240 days or more of actual working during the previous calendar year so as to be in conformity with the provisions of the , but as regards others matters it held that the directions given were quite clear and that under the guise of clarification the appellant could not seek a modification of the award under section 36A. ^ Held, that 36A of the , was intended to empower a tribunal to clarify the provisions of the award passed by it where a difficulty or doubt arose about their interpretation, and not to review or modify its own order.
Any question about the propriety, correctness or validity of any provision of the award would be outside the purview of the enquiry contemplated by that section.
