The Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949, came into force before the appellant landlords could obtain possession in execution of their decree for ejectment against the respondent tenants.
Failing to get the decree set aside under 0. 9, r. 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure the tenants made an application under section 28 of the said Act praying that the decree against them be set aside on the ground that they were Thika tenants, but the Munsif holding that they were not Thika tenants dismissed their application.
While an application by the tenants under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure against the Munsif 's order was pending in the High Court the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Ordinance, 1952, and the Calcutta Thika Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 1953, came into force.
The 1053 Amendment Act omitted section 28 of the Original Act.
The High Court after considering the effect of section 1(2) of the Amendment Act held that it did not affect the operation of section 28 of the Original Act which was applicable to these proceedings.
The High Court also found that the tenants were Thika Tenants 591 and remanded the case to the Munsif for disposal according to law whereupon the Munsif rescinded the decree.
On an application by the landlord under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure against the order of the Munsif rescinding the decree the High Court held that the question of applicability of section 28 was res judicata between the parties and could not be raised again before the High Court and dismissed the landlord 's application.
On appeal by the landlord by special leave the respondent contended that the appellant was barred by the principle of res judicata from raising before this Court the question whether on the enact ment of the Thika Tenancy Amendment Act, 1953, section 28 of the Original Act survives or not in respect of proceedings pending on the date of the commencement of the Thika Tenancy Ordinance, 1952 : Held, that the appellants were not precluded from raising before this Court the question that section 28 of the Original Thika Tenancy Act was not available to the tenants after the Thika Tenancy Amendment Act came into force merely because they had not appealed from the High Court 's order of remand.
An interlocutory order which did not terminate the proceedings and which had not been appealed from either because no appeal lay or even though an appeal lay an appeal was not taken, could be challenged in an appeal from the final decree or order.
