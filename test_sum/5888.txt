The appellant has bid in an auction of Beni Country Liquor Shop in the District of Samastipur and was given the shop being the highest bidder but he failed to deposit the bid money in time.
The Collector, Samastipur by an order cancelled the bid and black listed the appellant.
He then moved the High Court against the order of the Collector.
The High Court upheld the order of the Collector.
The appellant appealed to this Court by special leave.
Disposing of the appeal, the Court, HELD: 1.
It is an implied principle of the rule of law that any order having civil consequences should be passed only after following the principles of natural justice.
Black listing any person in respect of business ventures has civil consequences for the future business of the person concerned in any event.
[868H; 869A] 2.
Even if the rules do not express so, it is an elementary principle of natural justice that parties affected by any order should have right of being heard and making representations against the order.
[869B] In the instant case, that portion of the order directing that the appellant be placed in the black list in respect of future contracts under the Collector is set aside.
So far as the cancellation of the bid of the appellant is concerned, that is not affected.
[869B C]
