The appellant J who was enrolled as an advocate in the Chief Court of Sind in May 1947 came to India at the end of the year 1948, and practiced in the Courts at Delhi.

The question was whether this right continued to exist, after Sind ceased to form a part of India. ^ Held, that the Chief Court of Sind which was a High Court for the purposes of , upto August 14, 1947, ceased to exist as a High Court for the purposes of the , with effect from August 15, 1947, by virtue of section 5 of the India (Adaptation of Existing Indian Law) Order, 1947.
The necessary consequence of this was that the Roll maintained by the Chief Court of Sind was from August 15, 1947, no longer a roll maintained by a High Court within the meaning of the , and any person whose name was entered on the Roll of the Chief Court of Sind ceased to be an advocate for the purposes of section 14 of the , and therefore ceased to have the right under that section to practice in courts of India.
In the present case even though the appellant had a right on August 14, 1947, to practice in the courts subordinate to any High Court in India, such a right ceased to exist after the India (Adaptation of Existing Indian Laws) Order, 1947.
