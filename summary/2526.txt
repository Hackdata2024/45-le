On August 15, 1947 upon the passing of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 when paramountcy of the British crown lapsed, the erstwhile State of Baroda acceded to India.
By a. proclamation on August 25, 1948 the Maharaja of Baroda announced inter alia that the entire 'executive authority of the State would immediately vest in his Executive Council.
On March 21, 1949 he executed the Baroda Merger Agreement whereby the full powers in relation to the governance of the State were transferred to the Indian Government from May 1, 1949.
These powers were then delegated to the Provincial Government of Bombay.
The respondent was an official member of the Maharaja 's Executive Council of the State of Baroda.
In January.
1948 when it was considered likely that in view of the imminent constitutional changes m the State the members of the old Executive Council might be prematurely retired, the Maharaja enhanced the respondents salary, and by 'a Huzur order dated February 8, 1948, he fixed the pension and other retirement benefits of the respondent and another member of the Executive Council.
It was provided that in the event of their premature retirement, they would get 'as compensation an amount equivalent to what they would have received if they continued in service upto the date of retirement and a full pension of Rs. 500.00 per month from the date of the premature retirement.
On May 18, 1948, the Maharaja directed compulsory retirement of the respondent with effect from June 1, 1948 and he therefore drew Rs. 95,196.00 on account of his compensation.
At the instance of a new Executive Council the Maharaja passed another Huzur order on July 22, 1948 modifying his previous orders and directing that the respondent 'and the other officials would draw pension only when they reached the age of retirement and would in addition draw the salary to which they were eligible under the Account Rules.
On April 22, 1949, the new Executive Council purported to review and set aside the Huzur orders with respect to payment of compensation to the retired officials and directed, inter alia, that a sum of Rs. 77,416.00 out of the compensation received by the respondent be recovered.
from him under section 148 of the Baroda Land Revenue code.
He was compelled to refund Rs. 65,000.00 and a balance of Rs. 12,416.00 was demanded from him by the Collector of Baroda.
The respondent filed a suit against the State of Bombay asking inter alia for a declaration that the Huzur order dated February 8, 1948 as modified by the Huzur Order dated July 22, 1948 was binding on the defendants and that the order of the Executive Council of April 22, 1949 was invalid.
The Trial 756 Court decreed the suit and the High Court, in appeal, substantially upheld the respondent 's case but reduced the amount of the decree.
Apart from the validity of the Executive Council 's order of April 22, 1949, the other questions arising for determination in the 'appeal to this Court were whether the Government of Baroda was liable to pay the sum of Rs. 65,000 to the respondent; and if so, whether the liability devolved upon the appellant State of Gujarat.
HELD: Dismissing the appeal: (i) The Huzur order of February 8, 1948 was passed by the Maharaja in the exercise of his prerogative and inherent powers.
The Executive Council had no authority to revoke that order and until the Maharaja passed the entire executive authority to the Council on August 25, 1948, he was still the sovereign ruler.
The order of the Executive Council dated April 22, 1949 was therefore ultra vires and not binding upon the respondent.
[761 G] (ii) The direction in the order of April 22, 1949 for the recovery of monies under section 148 of the Baroda Land Revenue Code was illegal.
That section did not allow recovery of moneys payable under an order of the Executive Council.
The result of the illegal recovery of Rs. 65,000 from the respondent was that to the extent of that amount, the liability of the Baroda Government under the Huzur order dated February 8, 1948 remained outstanding.
[762 A] (iii) Clause (1) of Article VIII of the Baroda Merger Agreement guaranteed payment of reasonable compensation to officials whose services were dispensed with by the new Government.
Clause (2,) guaranteed the continuance of pension and leave salaries sanctioned by the Maharaja to officers who had retired before the date of the merger.
Article VIH thus furnishes strong evidence of recognition by the Government of India of the liability to pay retirement compensation under the Huzur order of February 8, 1948.
Furthermore, the successor Governments continued the old laws of the Baroda State until they were repealed or altered.
The appellant resisted the respondent 's claim on the.
basis only of the order of April 22, 1949 but as this was invalid, it must be held that the successor Governments recognised and took over liability under the Huzur order of February 8, 1948, which liability had since devolved on the appellant State of Gujarat.
Considering that the object of Article VIII was.
to guarantee payment of retirement benefits to retired public servants of the merged State, the word "pensionS" could not be given any narrow interpretation and would include the lump sum payable to the respondent as compensation under the Huzur order dated February 8, 1948 as modified by the Huzur order dated July 22, 1948.
