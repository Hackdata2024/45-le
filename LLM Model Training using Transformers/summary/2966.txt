Under the notification dated June 19, 1948 issued under section 3(A) of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948, sales tax at the rate of 6 pies in a rupee was payable on "cloth manufactured by mills".
Tax at that rate was sought to be levied on cloth manufactured by means of looms worked by power on the basis that it was "cloth manufactured by mills" within the meaning of the notification.
The High Court held that cloth manufactured by power looms could not fall under the term "cloth manufactured by mills".
Dismissing the appeal, HELD:What has to be seen is the context in which the word "mill" is used in the notification.
The notification, divides cloth broadly into two categories mill made and loom made.
Loom made cloth would include all cloth manufactured on looms and, therefore, whether the energy is supplied manually or by power cannot convert the essential character of the cloth, namely, its manufacture on looms.
As regards mill made cloth the actual process of weaving is more or less automatic, pre conceived and definite and it involves functioning of machinery.
In popular language a power loom cloth is never associated with a mill cloth.
[942H943A] Further, it cannot be said that once the looms worked by power are used in a building the essential characteristics of mills would be satisfied.
To hold so would be contrary to the accepted and popular meaning of hand loom or power loom cloth and mill made cloth.
The distinction which was kept in view when the notification was promulgated was between the aforesaid two categories or types of cloth involving essentially a difference in the process in which it was manufactured.
