Three separate suits for eviction by the appellant were brought against the three respondents within the framework of the Delhi & Ajmer Rent Control Act and were based on the provisions of section 13(g) for the bona fide requirements of rebuilding.
Terms of compromise which were substantially in accordance with the provisions of section 15 of the Act were put in by the parties and decrees were passed in the suits, under which the premises had to be vacated by the respondents on a specified day, which condition the respondents failed to observe and actually handed over the possession of the premises in suit at a later date.
On completion of the building the respondents filed an application under section 15 of the Act for their being put into possession.
The High Court inter alia held that though section 15 of the Act was not applicable to the proceedings yet the respondents could impose the terms of the decree and the proceedings could be treated as execution proceedings for enforcing the said terms.
The appellants challenged the judgments of the High Court and contended that on the facts of the case and the circumstances, the decrees in suit under section 13(1) proviso (d) shows that the order was passed and a decree made in accordance with the terms of section 15 of the Act and further it was significant that the respondents them selves had made the application to the Court under section 15 of the Act.
The respondents submitted that the decree was not one under section 15 of the Act because the decree was based on a compromise and the time for giving possession was not.
of the essence of the contract : Held, that as the tenant respondents did not deliver posses sion of the premises to the landlord appellant on or before the dates specified in the decree, the provisions of section 15 (3) of the Delhi and Ajmer Rent Control Act (38 of 1952) were not available to them and they were not entitled to be put in possession.
