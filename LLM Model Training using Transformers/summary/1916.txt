The respondent who was assessed to agricultural income tax made an application to the Assessing Officer depositing compensation Bonds and prayed that the Bonds be accepted in payment of tax dues.
This was rejected stating that there was no rule for acceptance of these bonds.
Another attempt by the respondent was also turned down by the Collector.
Thereafter the respondent presented a writ petition in the High Court for directing them to accept the Bonds in lieu off the tax dues.
The High Court was of the opinion that the two officers completely ignored the provisions of section 6(d) of the Act and r. 8A, and directed the Collector to decide the respondent 's application in accordance with law.
In appeal by special leave: HELD: (i) Neither section 6(d) nor r. 8A provide that the Bonds must or can be accepted in payment of tax on agriculture income.
[133 E] Collector of Sultanpur vs Raja Jagdish Prasad Sahi. , referred to.
(ii) When the compensation payable to an intermediary has been paid in the form of cash or Bonds.
that compensation ceased to be payable.
The fact that the Bonds are negotiable does not make them legal tender and does not make it obligatory on anyone including Government to accept them in payment of any dues.
The only result of their being treated as negotiable instruments is that the owner of the Bonds can transfer them to any person who is agreeable to purchase them.
