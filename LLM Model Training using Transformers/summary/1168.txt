The appellants exchanged their property in Pakistan with the property of an evacuee in India.
They applied for confir mation of the transaction which was granted by the Deputy Custodian.
Later, the Custodian revised the order and set aside the confirmation and ordered the ejectment of the appellants from the properties which were the subject of exchange.
He further ordered that they should render accounts of the rents and profits realised by them from this property.
The appellants contended that the Custodian bad no jurisdiction to pass any order requiring them to render accounts of the rents and profits.
Held, that the Custodian bad no power under the Adminis tration of Evacuee Property Act to direct a person in unauthorised possession of evacuee property to render accounts of rents and profits thereof without resorting to the ordinary remedy provided by law, that is, by way of suit.
