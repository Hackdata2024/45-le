The appellant was charged under Section 302 I.P.C. for committing the murder of the deceased.
At the trial, prose cution produced P.W.3, wife of the deceased, and P.Ws.10, 11 and 12, all eye witnesses.
Except for P.W.3, all other eye witnesses were declared hostile.
Thus, the prosecution depended on the sole testimony of P.W.3. P.W.3 deposed that she saw the appellant hitting her husband with a stick.
But admittedly, she did not disclose the name of the appellant to anybody including the Police.
The doctor, who came to the house of the deceased little later, examined and treated the deceased and removed him to the hospital deposed that he was told by the mother of the deceased that the family did not suspect anybody.
Another witness who was passing by the scene of occurrence also testified that nobody informed him about the appellant or any other person, who injured the deceased.
The Additional Sessions Judge acquitted the appellant.
But, on appeal, the High Court, set aside the acquittal order, and convicted and sentenced the appellant to impris onment for life.
Hence, the appeal by the accused.
Allowing the appeal, this Court, HELD: The conduct of the deceased 's wife was highly unnatural.
A wife, who has seen an assailant giving fatal blows with a stick to her husband, would name the assailant to all present and to the police at an earliest opportunity.
There is nothing in the evidence to justify this highly unnatural and improbable conduct of the deceased 's wife.
Even her statement recorded by police head constable, is entirely different than what she stated at the trial.
The prosecution has, thus, not 401 been able to prove its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
[404F G] Therefore, the appellant is given benefit of doubt, the judgment of the High Court is set aside, and the appellant is acquitted of the charge under section 302, IPC.
