One P died in 1874 leaving considerable property.
He also left a will which provided for several contingencies; the first respondent was given an interest under each contingency which was enlarged from contingency to contingency.
Under the last contingency which happened the entire property was given to the heirs with a direction that half of the income of the property be given to the first respondent.
The heirs contended that the direction merely created a charge and not a trust of half of the property.
Held, that the direction created a trust rather than a charge.
The charity was conceived to be a permanent one and it was necessary to secure regular payments to it.
The testator clearly intended that the heirs should regularly pay half the income to the first respondent so that the specified charities may be carried on perpetually.
This object could not be achieved if the direction merely created a charge and not a trust.
