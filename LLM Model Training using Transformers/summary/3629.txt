On the demise of Karuna, there were two rival claims for inheritance to his property.
One by the appellant who claimed it as his widowed mother, ' and the other by his father 's brother who contended that the appellant had remarried and was thereby barred from succeeding as Karuna 's heir.
After the consolidation officer had decided against her, and the settlement officer, Etah Camp, Aligarh, in her favour, the Deputy Director of Consolidation decided a revision petition against the appellant holding that her remarriage excluded her from the inheritance.
Thereafter, the appellant unsuccessfully filed a writ petition before the High Court.
Allowing the appeal, the Court HELD: Kasturi claimed inheritance not as a widow of her husband Madhua but as the mother of Karua.
We are entirely in agreement with the view that "unchastity of a mother is no bar to her succeeding as heir to her son, nor does her remarriage constitute any such bar".
Under the Hindu law, the bar of inheritance would not apply to a mother, as it would to a widow.
