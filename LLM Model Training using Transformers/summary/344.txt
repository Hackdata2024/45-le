The petitioners are carrying on business on a very large scale of making and selling bidis having their head office in Jabalpur in the State of Madhya Pradesh and are registered as "dealer" for the purposes of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947.
In the course of their said business, the petitioners import tobacco from the State of Bombay in very large quantities after it is blended in that State by the vendors with various other types of indigenous tobacco by an elaborate process.
This finished tobacco, after its import within the State of Madhya Pradesh is rolled into bidis which are exported to various other States, largely to the State of Uttar Pradesh.
The dealers in the State of Uttar Pradesh and such other States who buy bidis from the petitioners sell the same to various other dealers and consumers in those States.
The Sales Tax authorities in the State of Madhya Pradesh required the petitioners under threat of criminal prosecution to file a statement of return of the total purchases of tobacco made by them out of Madhya Pradesh and delivered to them in Madhya Pradesh with a view to assess and levy purchase tax on the transactions of purchases made by the petitioners as stated above.
Held, that the State of Madhya Pradesh had no authority to impose or to authorise the imposition of such a tax and that the action of the State authorities contravened the provisions of article 286(2) of the Constitution inasmuch as the transactions in question were in the course of inter State trade or commerce as the finished tobacco which was supplied to the petitioners moved from the State of Bombay to the State of Madhya Pradesh.
510 The contention that not only the petitioners were the registered dealers under Rule 8 of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Rules, 1947 but the dealers in Bombay who sell or supply tobacco to them were registered as "dealers" for the purpose of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947 and therefore the transactions were between two registered dealers in the State of Madhya Pradesh and thus constituted purely internal sales of the goods was without force because what one has to look at is the real nature of the transactions and not the outside form and as the trans actions in dispute involved movement of the goods across the border they were clearly transactions of sales of goods in the course of interState trade or commerce and were hit by the ban under article 286(2) of the Constitution.
