The appellant was the Ruler of the State of Baster which was later integrated with the State of Madhya Pradesh.
He was recognised by the President as a Ruler under article 366(22) of the Constitution.
The respondent resumed certain lands belonging to the appellant under the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950.
The appellant contended that he was still a Ruler and not an ex Ruler and as such did not come within the definition of "proprietor" given in the Act.
Held, that the appellant was an ex Ruler for the purposes of the Act and was within the class of persons who were by name included in the definition of 'proprietor ' and was within the scope of the Act.
Factually the appellant was an ex Ruler.
He was a Ruler for the purposes of the privy purse guaranteed to him.
There was nothing in article 366(22) which required a court to treat such a person as a Ruler for purposes outside the Constitution.
Further, the appellant was also a maufidar in respect of the lands acquired which were exempt from the payment of rent or tax.
The expression "maufidar" was not necessarily confined to a grantee from a State or a Ruler of a State; he could be the holder of land which was exempted from payment of rent or tax.
