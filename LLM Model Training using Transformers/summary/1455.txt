A Sub Inspcctor of Police, Enforcement Branch, filed a report before the Police Officer in charge of a Police Station alleging that the respondent along with three others committed offences under ss.420, 120B read with s.420 Indian Penal Code.
Thereupon a First Information Report was drawn up and investigation was started.
The respondent surrendered before the judicial Magistrate and he was released on bail.
Subsequently he filed an application in the High Court under sections 439 and 561 A of the Criminal Procedure Code to get the case pending before the judicial Magistrate arising out of the 53 case registered in the Police Station quashed.
This appli cation was granted by the High Court.
The appellant the State of West Bengal then filed an appeal before the Supreme Court by certificate granted by the High Court under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution.
Held, that the statutory powers given to the Police under sections 154 and 156 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to investigate into the circumstances of an alleged cognizable offence without authority from a Magistrate cannot be interfered with by the exercise of powers under s.439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or under the inherent powers conferred by section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The High Court was therefore in error in allowing the respondent 's application.
King Emperor vs Khwaja Nazir Ahmad, (1944) L.R. 71 I.A. 203 allowed.
