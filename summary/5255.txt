On a complaint being filed under section 120(b) read with ss.467 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code, the Metropolitan Magistrate summoned the appellant and thereafter rejected his objection about the maintainability of his prosecution for want of sanction under section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code, holding that section 197 does not apply because the appel lant is an officer who is removable from his office by a competent authority and no sanction of the Government is necessary.
This view was affirmed by the High Court.
In the appeal to this Court, on behalf of the appellant it was contended: (i) that after the nationalisation of the Department of the appellant he will fall within the defini tion of public servant and, therefore, section 197 will be at tracted and (ii) that although the competent authority who can remove the appellant from service is not the Government, but it has been empowered under the regulations framed under the Act of Parliament with the approval and sanction of the Central Government and, therefore, the view taken by the Courts below is not correct.
Dismissing the Appeal, HELD: It is clear that section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code is attracted only in cases where the public servant is such who is not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the Government.
[219B] In the instant case, it is not disputed that the appellant is not 217 holding a post where he could not be removed from service except by or with the sanction of the Government.
In this view of the matter even if it is held that appellant is a public servant still provisions of section 197 are not attracted at all.
Therefore, the view taken by the Courts below could not be said to be erroneous.
