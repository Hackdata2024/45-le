The respondent was working as an Executive Engineer in the Hyderabad State.
In 1955, the Public Service Commission recommended that: he should be stopped from crossing the efficiency bar with effect from February 9, 1952; and (2) a sum of Rs. 23,371 should be recovered from his salary on account of loss caused to the Government by his negligence.
On November 1, 1956 the States Reorganisation Act came into force ,red the respondent was allotted to the appellant State.
Even after the respondent completed the age of 55 years in 1960, he was continued in service by the appellant State, but under suspension pending completion of the; disciplinary proceedings against him, but in 1961, he was permitted 10 retire and all the disciplinary proceedings pending against him were dropped altogether.
After his retirement, he filed a writ petition for a declaration that he was stopped from crossing the efficiency bar only because the Government wanted to reimburse itself for the loss caused by the respondent, that consequent upon the dropping ,of the proceedings against him, he should be deemed not to have caused any loss to the Government, and so, to have crossed the efficiency bar on February 9, 1952.
and therefore, the increments withheld should be restored and the increased salary should be taken into 'account in fixing his pension.
The High Court allowed the petition.
In appeal to this Court, HELD: Merely because the disciplinary proceedings against him were dropped for certain reasons it did not automatically follow that the respondent was allowed to cross the efficiency bar.
Under the Civil Service Rules in Hyderabad and in Mysore, an express order of the appropriate authority is necessary before an officer was allowed to cross the efficiency bar and no such order was passed in the present case.
