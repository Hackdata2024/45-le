The petitioner, who was detained under sub section (2) of section 3 of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti Social Activities Act, 1985, by an order dated 11th june, 1987 filed a writ petition in this Court, alleging that both the detaining authority as also the State Government had not considered the representation, dated 15th july, 1987 made by him, with utmost promptitude and that, in fact, there was no disposal of the said representation by these authorities.
In the counter affidavit filed by the detaining authority, it was averred that the representation, received by it on 21st July 1987 was duly considered and rejected the same day.
Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: The right of representation under Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India is a valuable and constitutional right.
The Government is expected to ensure that the constitutional safeguards embodied in Article 22(5) are strictly observed.
[830E F] Mohinuddin vs District Magistrate, Beed & Ors., ; relied on.
In the instant case, the petitioner had the right to make a representation not only to the detaining authority but also to the State Government which had the power to revocation.
Although the representation made by him to the detaining authority has been considered and rejected, this is not a substantial compliance of the 829 constitutional rights enshrined in Article 22(5) of the Constitution.
The allegation made by the petitioner that he made a further representation to the State Government had not been controverted.
The State Government had disdained from filing any counter affidavit for obvious reasons.
[830C E] The wholly unexplained and unduly long delay rather the undeniable failure on the part of the State Government in the disposal of the representation, renders the detention of the petitioner iilegal.
[829G H] The order of detention made under sub section (2) of section 3 of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti Social Activities Act, 1985 is accordingly quashed.
