The appellant filed a suit in the Calcutta High Court challenging his; removal, after a departmental enquiry, from the post of Assistant Director of Fire Services and Regional Officer Calcutta Industrial Area.
The suit was decreed in his favour,by the Civil Judge but the Division Bench reversed the decree.
In appeal to this Court, by certificate the question was whether the appellant had been denied a reasonable opportunity to defend himself inasmuch as the charges were vague and no statement of allegations as required by Fundamental Rule 55 of the Central Service (Classification Control & Appeal) Rules was furnished to him.
HELD: The appeal must be allowed: The appellant repeatedly and at every stage brought to the notice of the authorities concerned that he had not been supplied the statement of allegations and that the charges were extremely vague and indefinite.
In spite of this he was not informed of the facts and Circumstances and particulars relevant to the charges.
The entire proceedings showed a complete disregard of Fundamental Rule 55 in so far as it lays down in an almost mandatory manner that the charges must be accompanied by a statement of allegations.
There could be no doubt that the appellant was denied a proper and reasonable chance to defend himself by reason of the charges being altogether vague and indefinite and the statement of allegations containing the material facts and particulars not having been supplied to him.
