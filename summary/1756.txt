The constitutionality of the Madras Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961 was attacked on the ground that it violated articles 14, 19, 31(2) of the Constitution.
Held (i) The provisions of section 5(1) of the Act result in discrimination between persons equally circumstanced and are thus violative of article 14 of the Constitution.
As this section is the basis of Chapter II of the Act, the whole chapter must fall along with it.
The ratio of Karimbil Kunhikoman vs State of Kerala [1962] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 829 applies with full force to the present case.
(ii)The provisions in section 50 read with Sch.
III of the Act with respect to compensation are discriminatory and violate article 14 of the Constitution.
Karimbil Kunhikoman vs State of Kerala [1962] Supp.
S.C.R. 829, followed.
(iii)Ss.
5 and 50 are the pivotal pro visions of the Act, and as they fall, the whole Act must be struck down as unconstitutional.
