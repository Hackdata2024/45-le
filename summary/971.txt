The appellants house was searched on June 22, 1951, by the Customs authorities and ten articles were recovered therefrom.
In the inquiry before the Collector the appellant stated that the first five articles had been brought by him in 1947 from Pakistan after partition and that with respect to the other five articles he was a bona fide purchaser thereof.
The Collector held that the appellant had failed to establish his case and held that the goods were imported into India in contravention Of section 3, Import Export Control Act read with sections 19 and 167(8), Sea Customs Act and sections 4 and 5 Land Customs Act read with section 7 thereof.
This decision was upheld on appeal by the Central Board of Revenue and by the Central Government on revision.
The appellant contended that: (i) the onus of proving that the first five articles were smuggled goods was on the department which it had failed to discharge, and (2) even if the other five articles which he purchased were smuggled goods he was not concerned with their importation.
Held, that the onus was on the authorities to establish that the first five articles were imported into India after March 1948, when the customs barrier was put up for the first time between India and Pakistan, and that the authorities having failed to adduce any evidence to prove this fact the appellant could not be held guilty of any of the offences charged.
The onus did not shift by virtue Of section 178A, Sea Customs Act or section 5, Land Customs Act, as the former section was not in operation at the relevant time and the latter section was not applicable to the facts of this case ; nor did the onus shift by virtue of section 106, Evidence Act, as that section could not be used to undermine the well established rule that the burden was on the prosecution and never shifted.
