The appellants ' predecessor was inducted as an usufructuary mortgagee of certain fields.
On the expiry of redemption period the respondents filed a suit for redemption which was decreed subject to payment of damages for improvements.
On appeal, the District Court confirmed the redemption decree but set aside the decree for damages.
In second appeal, the appellants raised a new plea: that they were deemed tenants by operation of Section 2 A of the Bombay Tenancy Act, 1939.
It was also contended on their behalf that Section 85 A of the Act ousted the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to decide the dispute of tenancy rights In pending suit.
Rejecting both the contentions the High Court confirmed the decree of the appellate court.
Against the judgment of the High Court an appeal was flied in this Court.
Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1.
The plea based on Section 2 A was sought to be raised for the first time in second appeal before the High Court.
It was neither raised in the pleadings nor argued either before the trial Court or the appellate court.
Therefore, the High Court rightly did not permit the appellants to raise the plea of a deemed tenancy as the said claim needs investigation based on factual foundation which was lacking.
Consequently, the question whether under Section 85 A the Civil Court had jurisdiction or not need not be gone into.
