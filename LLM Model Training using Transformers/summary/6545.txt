The Andhra Pradesh State Government appointed a Pay Revision Commissioner in 1977, for revision of pay scales in respect of its employees.
The Commissioner was also directed to review the then existing retirement benefits and to make suitable recommendations regarding extension of retirement benefits.
He submitted his report and recommended that the revised scales be made effective from 1.4.78.
He also recom mended that the retirement age should be increased from 55 years to 58 years.
Accepting the report, the State Government implemented the recommendations regarding pay scales effective from 1.4.78.
The recommendation regarding increase in retirement age was implemented with effect from 29.10.1979.
The State Government promulgated the Revised Pension Rules, 1980, which made a distinction between Government servants who were in service as on 29th October, 1979 (Part I) and those Government servants who retired/died in between 1.4.78 and 28.10.79.
(Part II).
By these Writ Petitions, the petitioners challenged the Revised Pension Rules, 1980 on the ground that the said Rules created two different categories of pensioners with different rates of pension which was completely arbitrary and in violation of this Court 's decision in D.S. Nakara & Ors.
vs Union of India, ; The Respondent State contended that the increase In the age of superannuation could not be implemented retrospec tively as it would have led to a lot of difficulties, but to compensate those who retired after April 1, 1978 and before October 29, 1979 the Government gave them certain benefits.
It was further contended that since the date of superannua tion was enhanced to 58 years on 29.10.1979 it was neces 6 sary to draw a line between those who retired earlier to that date and those who retired subsequent to 29.10.1979, which was not arbitrary and the rules guarantee 50% of pension to both categories irrespective of the date of retirement.
Dismissing the writ petitions, HELD: 1.
The claim of the petitioners is based on a complete misconception of the Rules.
A perusal of the Rules clearly goes to show that Part I of the Rules was no doubt made applicable to all Government servants who would retire on or after 29.10.1979 while Part II was made applicable to such Government servants who were holding pensionable posts on 31st March, 1978 and who retired between 1st April, 1978 and 28th October, 1979 and this distinction was necessary in view of the fact that the age of superannuation for retire ment was increased from 55 years to 58 years w.e.f.
29th October, 1979.
[9G H; 10A] 2.
All the benefits have been granted to the pensioners like the petitioners who had retired between 1.4.1978 and 29.10.1979 in the amount of pension, retirement gratuity and family pension as granted to the Government servants falling under Part I So far as the amount of pension is concerned, the formula of completed six monthly periods of qualifying service was worked out as 30/60 of average emoluments which was equal to 50% of the pay.
On account of the fact that the Government servants falling in Part I are retiring at the superannuation age of 58 years the above formula was calcu lated as 33/66 which was also 50% of the average emoluments.
Similarly in the case of retirement gratuity and family pension no distinction has been made in the case of the two categories of pensioners.
This clearly goes to show that neither there is any discrimination nor any disadvantage to the pensioners falling in the category of petitioners and the formula working out the amount of pension is based on a rational principle and it cannot be said that such differen tial rates have no reasonable nexus to the object sought to be achieved or the same are in any manner violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.
