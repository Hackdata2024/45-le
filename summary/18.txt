Held per KANIA (C.J. FAZL ALl, and MAHAJAN JJ.
(MUKH ERJEA and PATANJALI SASTRI JJ.
dissenting).
The functions and duties of the Industrial Tribunal constituted under , are very much like those of a body discharging judicial functions although it is not a Court, and under article 136 of the Constitution of India the Supreme Court jurisdiction to entertain an application for leave to appeal from decision of the Tribunal, even though it will be very to entertain such an application.
Per MUKERJEA J. (PATANJALI SASTRI J. concurring).
An Industrial Tribunal functioning under the is not a judicial tribunal.
The nature of the determinations made and the materials and considerations on which it has to decide a dispute are also such that the powers of an appellate court cannot be exer cised fully and effectively in respect of them and such determinations are therefore outside the purview of article 136 of the Constitution.
Even assuming that the Court had jurisdiction appeal, the present case was not a fit one for entertaining an appeal from the determination of the Tribunal.
[On the merits KANlA C. J., FAZL ALl, PATANJALI SASTRI and MUKHERJEA, JJ.
were of opinion that there was no ground for admitting the appeal.
MAHAJAN J. was of opinion that the award was bad and must be set aside.]
