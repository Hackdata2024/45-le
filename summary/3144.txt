The assessee firm applied for renewal of its registration under s.26A, Income Tax Act, 1922, in May 1958, stating that the income of the previous year, which ended on March 31, 1958, had been divided among the partners.
The Department Tribunal and the High Court did not believe that the previous year 's income had been divided and rejected the application.
Dismissing the appeal to this Court, HELD : From a reading of the section and rules 2, 3 and 6 of the In,come tax Rules and the forms prescribed, it is clear that in the case of an application for renewal, it is incumbent on the part of the assessee to have divided the previous year 's profits before the application for renewal is made.
The fact that the interpretation may cause hardship to the assessee is irrelevant when the language is plain.
