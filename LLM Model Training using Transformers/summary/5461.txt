The employees of the State Bank of India filed a writ petition in the High Court, questioning the right of the management to fix the hours of work and of recess and its right to stagger the period of recess, and for other consequential reliefs.
A Single Judge of the High Court allowed the petition, following earlier decisions by the Division Bench of the same High Court, and also granted a certificate of fitness under Article 134A of the Constitution to file an appeal in the Supreme Court, following an earlier order of a Division Bench granting such a certificate in respect of one of those earlier decisions.
Revoking the certificate, this Court, HELD: The certificate contemplated under Article 134A of the Constitution can only be a certificate which is referred to in cl.
(1) of Article 132 or in cl.
(1) of Article 133 or in sub clause (c) of cl.
(1) of Article 134 of the Constitution.
Article 134A does not constitute an independent provision under which a certificate can be issued.
It is ancilliary to Articles 132(1), 133(1) and 134(1)(c).
[155E] The High Court can issue a certificate only when it is satisfied that the conditions in Article 132 or Article 133 or Article 134, as the case may be, are satisfied.
[156F] The instant case does not fall either under Article 132(1) or under sub clause(c) of Article 134(1) as it neither involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution nor is it a crimi 154 nal proceeding.
It can only fall, if at all, under Article 133(1) and,therefore, the certificate could not have been issued by reason of cl.(3) of Article 133 of the Constitution.
[155E F] The fact that in a similar case a certificate had been issued by a Division Bench of the High Court did not empower the Single Judge to issue the certificate under Article 133(1) in a case decided by him.
The restriction placed by cl.
(3) of Article 133 could not be got over by relying upon the order of the Division Bench.
[156G H] The petition of appeal to be treated as Special Leave Petition under Article 136 of the Constitution and posted for preliminary hearing.
