The positions of an agent, a servant and independent contractor are distinguished as under: An agent is to be distinguished on the one hand from a servant, and on the other from an independent contractor.
A servant acts under the direct control and supervision of his master, and is bound to conform to all reasonable orders given to him in the course of his work; an independent contractor, on the other hand, is entirely independent of any control or interference and merely undertakes to produce a specified result, employing his own means to produce that result.
An agent, though bound to exercise his authority in accordance with all lawful instructions which may be given to him from time to time by his principal, is not subject in its exercise to the direct control or supervision of the principal.
An agent, as such is not 9, servant, but a servant is generally for some purposes his master 's implied agent, the extent of the agency depending upon the duties or position of the servant.
