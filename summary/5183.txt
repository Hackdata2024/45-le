In respect of certain incident dated 2.4.1974, the First Information Report has been registered suo motu by the Police after 3 1/2 years, on the basis of the report of Commission of Inquiry.
The victims of the injuries were also accused of criminal offences said to have taken place at the same point of time who were produced before the Judicial Magistrate of Bhiwani on 2.4.74 and were also medically examined.
They did not file any private complaint, though released on bail.
Based on the report of the Investigating Agency under section 173(8) of the Code of Criminal Proce dure Code, the Public Prosecutor filed an application under section 321 of the Code for withdrawal of the prosecution case which was granted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bhiwani.
The High Court also affirmed the said order.
Hence the Special Leave Petitions.
Dismissing the petitions, the Court, HELD: In the facts and circumstances of the case, it is in public interest that the Prosecution should not proceed with the prosecution.
A report under section 173(8) of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the investigating agency indicated that adequate evidence has not been forthcoming to support the prosecution which was commenced suo motu on the basis of a report of the Commission of Inquiry on whose finding no conviction can lie.
The victims themselves who were the accused of criminal offences said to have taken place at the same point of time did not complain before the Magistrate concerned and did not file private complaints.
The pica that one of the accused persons was the son of a political figure wielding influence did not deter the Magis trate in ordering release the victims in the earlier case.
Further chances of conviction are too far fetched and bleak.
