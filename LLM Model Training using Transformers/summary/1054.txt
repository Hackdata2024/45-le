Section 2(5) of the , properly construed, does not by itself confer the power on the appropriate Government to make a reference.
That power is really contained in section 10(i) of the Act.
In deciding whether it should or should not make a reference under section 12(5) of the Act the appropriate Government need not base its decision solely on the report of the conciliation officer, but is free to take into consideration all other relevant facts and circumstances under section 10(1), and where it refused to make a reference it must record and com municate its reasons therefore to the parties concerned.
Such reasons, however, must be germane, and not extraneous or irrelevant, to the dispute.
But in exercising such wide powers as are conferred by section 10(1), the appropriate Government must act fairly and reasonably and not in a punitive spirit, and although considerations of expediency may not be wholly excluded, it must not be swayed by any extraneous considerations.
Consequently, in a case where the issues in dispute related to a claim of classification for specified employees and additional bonus and the sole ground on which the Government refused to refer the dispute for adjudication under section 12(5) was that the employees had adopted go slow tactics during the relevant year, although the company had nevertheless voluntarily paid three months ' bonus for that year and the report of the conciliation officer was in favour of the employees, Held, that the Government acted on irrelevant considerations and its decision being wholly punitive in character a clear case for the issue of a writ of mandamus was made out.
Held, further, that since the work done by the employees prima facie justified the claim for classification and it was in consonance with the practice prevailing in other comparable concerns, the misconduct of the respondents could be no ground for refusing reference as the claim was in regard to the future benefit to the employees.
228 The claim of bonus being also prima facie justified by the profits earned during the relevant year in accordance with well settled principles of industrial adjudication, the order of refusal was in the nature of a punitive action that was wholly inconsistent with the object of the Act.
