The plaintiff which is the Committee of Management for all Gurudwaras situated within the Municipal limits of Amritsar, except the Gurudwara Sri Akal Takht Sabib, was constituted prior to the year 1930 and by virtue of section 85(2) of the Sikh Gurudwaras Act (Punjab Act VIII of 1925) became the Committee concerned with the suit Gurudwara.
There were certain proceedings under the Act in respect of the suit properties which were ultimately decided by the High Court on the 16th June 1936 and the decision was followed by a notification under section 17 of the Act on the 3rd March 1937.
As a result the plaintiff became entitled to get possession of the said properties by instituting a suit before a tribunal under section 25 A of the Act within one year from the date of the decision or the date of the constitution of the Committee, whichever was later.
The present suit was filed on the 25th February 1938 which was beyond one year of the decision and the question was whether the suit can be said to have been instituted within one year of the date of the constitution of the Committee of the Gurudwara concerned, the contention being that the plaintiff must be deemed to have become the committee concerned with the suit Gurudwara only on the date of the notification thereof in 1937 under section 17 of the Act by virtue of the provisions of sections 86 and 88.
Held, that the date of the notification in 1937 under section 17 cannot be deemed to be the date of the constitution of the Committee concerned for the purposes of section 25 A and that the present suit is barred by limitation.
Section 86 does not apply to Gurudwaras within the Municipal limits of Amritsar specified in section 85, in respect of which a Committee already exists and by virtue of sub section (2) of section 88 the date of the publication of the notification of the Committee which already has been in existence since 1930 will be the date of the constitution of the Committee within the meaning of section 25 A.
