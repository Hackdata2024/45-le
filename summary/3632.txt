The proviso to section 3(1)(vii) of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1964.
provided that nothing in clauses (i) to (vii) of section 3(1) shall affect the rights of persons who are entitled to the fixity of tenure immediately before 21 January 1961 under any law then in force.
The law prevailing immediate ly before 21 January 1961, was the Malabar Tenancy Act, 1929.
Under section 23 of that Act a tenant would be liable to be evicted from his holding at the instance of h/s landlord if he intentionally committed acts of waste or defaulted in the payment of rent for more than 3 months.
The proviso was amended by 1969 Amendment Act which came into force on January 1; 1970.
The amending Act also.
inserted in the Act new Ss.
50A. 52 and 73.
Section 50A provided that a tenant entitled to fixity of tenure shall have the right to use his holding in any manner he thinks fit.
Section 52 pro vided that a cultivating tenant shall have a right to cut .trees and section 73 is to the effect that the maximum amount that could be claimed by way of arrears of rent is only for 3 years.
Section 108(2) was also amended and it provided that any decree passed before the commencement of the section for the dispossession of a person from the land in his possession may on the application.
of such person be reopened and disposed of in accordance with the provi sions of the 1964 Act as amended by the 1969 Act provided dispossession has not been affected.
Section 125(3) provid ed that if in any suit or proceeding questions regarding the rights of a tenant arose, the civil court shall stay such proceedings and refer the question to the Land Tribunal having jurisdiction over the area.
Section 132(3) provided that any decree pursuant to which eviction has not been effected may, on the application of the tenant or the land lord be reopened and the matter disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
The respondent owned about 550 acres out of which more than half was Coffee planted area.
He leased the plantation and the remaining unplanted area to the appellant in 1950 for 12 years.
Clause (4) of the lease provided that if the rent was in arrears for 30 days after it became due it was lawful for the lessor to forfeit the lease and re enter on the land.
Alleging_ that since 1953 the 'appellant had neglected to pay the rent, the respondent filed the suit claiming possession of the land, arrears of rent, and dam ages for waste.
The trial court decreed the suit in.
1966 and the decree was confirmed by the 'High Court with the enhanced damages in February 1969.
In appeal to this Court the appellant contended that he was entitled to fixity of tenure; that the unplanted area was not a plantation and 'so he was entitled to fixity of tenure therein; ,hat the pro ceedings were to be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the 1964 Act as amended by 1969 Amendment Act.
that is.
that all questions regarding rights of tenants and landlords could be decided only by the Land Tribunal; and that the damages were awarded contrary to the 'provisions of the Act as amended.
He, therefore.
filed an application praying for reopening of the decree passed by the High Court and also contended that in view of the amendments in 1971 the appeal is to be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the Act, as amended in 1969 and 1971.
Dismissing the appeal to this COurt,.
HELD: In the present case, the decree was passed by the trial court as ' well as by the High Court after the 1964 Act came into force but before the, 1027 1969 amendment.
The decree was correctly passed in ac cordance with the provisions of the 1964 Act, since the amendments were prospective and not retrospective.
[1036 E F] .rm60 (1) A statute has to be looked into for the general scope and purview of the statute and at the remedy sought to be applied.
In that connection the former state of law is to be considered and also the legislative changes contemplated by the statute.
Words not requiring retrospective operation so as to affect an existing statutory provision prejudicially ought not to be so construed.
It is a general rule that when the legislature alters the rights of the parties by taking away or conferring any right of action, its enactments.unless in express terms they apply to pending actions, do not affect them.
If however, a statute deals merely with procedure in an action and does not affect the rights of the parties, it will be held to apply prima facie to all actions pending as well as future.

Durden (1948) 2 Exch.22 and Smithies vs National Union of Operative Plasterers , referred to.
(2) The entire land leased out does not come within the definition of plantation, because.
the extent of coffee cultivated area has been found to have dwindled to about 100 acres out of the total extent of about 550 acres by reason of the acts of waste committed by the appellant and ceased to be a plantation even before 1 January 1970.
The appel lant, however, is disentitled to take advantage of his own wrongs so as to claim statutory benefits which were also not available to him.
[1033 A B, E G] (3) The appellant had been found to be habitual defaulter since 1952 in the payment of rent and to be guilty of wilful acts of waste before and after the institution of the suit.
He had denuded the entire tree growth in morethan one half of the area and destroyed more than one half of the coffee planted area, and the remaining part was in an utterly neglected condition.
Therefore.
under section 23.
Malabar Tenan cy Act, the appellant had no fixity of tenure on 21 Janu ary 1961, and hence was not entitled to the benefit of proviso to section 3(1) either under the 1964 Act or the 1969 Act.
[1032 G H, 1034.B D)] (4) The respondent was a Government company.
Under section 3(1)(i) of the 1964 Act, leases of lands owned by Government companies are exempted from the provisions of Chap.
Section 13, which is in Chap.
II and which provides for fixity of tenure cannot therefore be invoiced.
by the appel lant for claiming 'fixity, of tenure under the 1964 Act.
[1033 C D] (5) The appellant is disentitled from invoking sections 50A, 52 and 73 of the 1964 Act as amended in 1969 because, Chap ter 1I of the 1964 Act is not applicable to the lease since the respondent lessor iS a Government Company.
More over, these sections came into effect on 1st January 1970 and were not retrospective, but were.
prospective in.
opera tion.
[1032 A D, 1033 H, 1036 A B] (6) Sect.ion 108(3) of the Act as amended in 1971 will permit the opening of the decree only if a person has claims to a right benefit or remedy which has been conferred on him under the Act.
In the present case neither under the 1964 Act nor under the 1969 Amendment the.
appellant can claim the benefit of section 50A because he wilfully misused the hold ing and caused acts of waste causing loss to the lessor and damage and destruction to the holding.
[1033 H, 1034 A B] (7) Section 125(1) of the Act which came into force on 1 January 1970, creates bar against the civil court deciding questions required to be settled by the Land Board.
This provision is prospective.
and the proviso expressly states that the section shall not apply to proceedings pending in any court at the commencement of the 1969 amending Act.
It, therefore, follows that the proceedings in the present case which were pending at the commencement of the 1969 Amendment Act are saved from the operation of section 125(1).
Section 125(3) is equally prospective.
It will be applied with regard to the provisions contained in section 125(1) of the Act.
Matters which will be within the mischief of section 125(1) are matters which will arise in suits or proceedings initiated or originated after the commencement of the Act.
It is unsound to 1028 suggest that pending proceedings which are exempt from the application of section 125(1) will yet fall within that sub section by reference to section 125(3).
Therefore, the provisions contained in section 125 are not applicable in the present case.
