Section 233 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Act V of 1898) embodies the general law as to the joinder of charges and lays down a rule that for every distinct offence there should.
be a 589 separate charge and every such charge should be tried separately.
No doubt the object of section 233 is to save the accused from being embarrassed in his defence if distinct offences are lumped together in one charge or in separate charges and are tried together but the Legislature has engrafted certain exceptions upon this rule contained in sections 234, 235, 236 and 239.
Section 235 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that if in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for every such offence.
The prosecution story showed that the offence of extortion committed on a particular day was one of a series of acts connected with the offence of murder and attempt to murder committed on their previous day in such a way as to form one transaction.
The incidents related in the evidence left no doubt that from the moment the accused (a Reserve Inspector of Police) started from the Police State, he committed a series of acts involving killing, injuring people, unlawfully confining others and extorting money from one of them and therefore the series of acts attributed to him constituted one transaction in the course of which two offences which were alleged to be distinct were committed.
Held, that under the circumstances the case fell within the purview of section 235 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and such joinder was permitted by the exception enacted in that section.
Where the two Judges of the High Court on appeal are divided in their opinion as to the guilt of the accused and the third Judge to whom reference is made agrees with one of them who is upholding the conviction and sentence, it is desirable as a matter of convention though not as a matter of strict law that ordinarily the extreme penalty should not be imposed.
