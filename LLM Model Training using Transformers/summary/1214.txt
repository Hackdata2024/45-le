Under sections 3 and 8 of the U. P. the Governor issued an Order dated March 10, 1948, making dletailed provisions for the settlement of Industrial Disputes.
Clause 5(a) of the Government Order empowered, among others, a recognised association of employers to refer an industrial dispute for adjudication to the Conciliation Board.
Clause 23 provided that no employer shall discharge or dismiss any workman during the pendency of an inquiry except with the written permission of the Regional Conciliation Officer, and Cl. 26 provided for penalties for contravention of Cl. 23.
The appellant proposed to dismiss certain workmen.
Though at the time there was a dispute pending inquiry, the appellant did not seek permission under cl. 23 to dismiss the workmen; but the Employers ' Associa tion of Northern India made an application under cl.
5(a) to the Board to adjudicate and give an award that the appellant was entitled to dismiss the workmen.
The workmen contended that the reference under cl.
5(a) was incompetent as the appellant had ,not first taken proceedings under Cl.
Held, that the application under cl.
5(a) of the G. O. was not 24 186 maintainable, as the employer could not take advantage of cl.
5(a) during the pendency of an inquiry when Cl. 23 was applicable.
If cls.
5(a) and 23 were held to ' apply at the same time there would be disharmony as by resorting to cl.
5(a) when Cl. 23 was applicable, the employers would be contravening cl. 23 and rendering themselves liable to the penalties under section 26.
But there was complete harmony if it was held that cl.
5(a) applied in all other cases of dismissal or discharge except where an inquiry was pending within the meaning of Cl. 23.
Besides Cl. 23 was a special provision which prevailed over the general provisions in cl.
