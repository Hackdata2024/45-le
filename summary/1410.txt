In exercise of the power conferred by 5. 5 of the Coal Mines Provident Fund and Bonus Schemes Act, 1948, the Central Government framed a Bonus Scheme for the payment of bonus to employees of coal mines.
Paragraph 3 of the scheme made every employee in a coal mine eligible for a bonus except, infer alia, "a mali on domestic and personal work".
The question for consideration was whether under this paragraph the malis working in the officers ' bungalows had any right to bonus. ^ Held, that these malis were not entitled to any bonus under the Bonus Scheme.
Paragraph 3 contemplated malis who were employees of the colliery owners and were yet on domestic work.
Domestic meant as of the home.
The malis 884 who were working in the bungalows occupied by the officers, were working in the homes of the officers.
They were therefore, on domestic work.
The work they were doing did not cease to be domestic work because the bungalows belonged not to the officers but to the appellant or because they were under the control and orders of the appellant.
Further, these malis were on personal work.
The word "personal" was used in the sense of work for an individual as distinguished from work for the coal mine as an institution.
These malis were undoubtedly working for the officers as individuals.
