Order 32, r. 7(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, which is intended to protect the interest of the minor, really means that an agreement or compromise entered into on behalf of the minor in contravention of 0. 32, r. 7(1) is voidable only at the instance of the minor and not at the instance of any other party to it.
Such contravention does not render the agreement or decree a nullity and the same has to be avoided in an appropriate proceeding.
Manohar Lal vs jadu Nath Singh (1906) L.R. 33 I.A. 128, referred to.
Chhabba Lal vs Kallu Lal (1946) L.R. 73 I.A. 52, jamna Bai vs Vasanta Rao (1916) L.R. 43 I.A. 99 and Khiarajmal vs Daim (1904) L.R. 32 I.A. 23, held inapplicable.
Where a preliminary decree is passed in non compliance with the provision of 0. 32, r. 7(1), the remedy of the minor is by way of an appeal against that decree and not against the final decree since section 97 of the Code is a bar to the challenging of the preliminary decree in an appeal against the final decree.
Consequently, in a suit for the partition where preliminary decree by consent was passed against the minor in contravention of 0. 32, r. 7(i) and that decree having been sought to be set aside in an appeal from the final decree the High Court held that section 97 of the Code precluded the appellant from doing so.
Held, that the decision of the High Court was correct and must be ashamed, 770 Held, further, that the object section 97 of the Code was intended to achieve would be wholly frustrated if it were to be held that the section merely prohibited a challenge to the factual correctness of the decree and not its legal validity.
