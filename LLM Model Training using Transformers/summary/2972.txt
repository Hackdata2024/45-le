On the matter being referred to a large bench , HELD : The respondent 's contention must be accepted.
In Rambhai Ashabhai Patel 's case it was ruled that this Court has power to decide all the points arising from the judgment appealed against and even in the absence of an express provision like OXLI r. 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure, this Court can devise appropriate procedure to be adopted at the hearing and there could be no better way of supplying the deficiency than by drawing upon the provisions of a general law like the Code of Civil Procedure and adopting such of those provisions as are ,suitable.
The decision of the Court did not rest either on the ground that the appeal before it was brought by special leave or on the interpretation of section 116A as it then stood.
