Inter State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979 is a benefi cial legislation for satisfying the provisions of the Con stitution and the obligation in international agreements to which India is a party.

To implement the provisions of the Act every State and Union Territory in India would be obliged to permit officers of originating States of migrant labour for holding appropriate inquiries within the limits of the Recepient States for enforcement of the statute and no Recepient State shall place any embargo or hindrance in such process.
