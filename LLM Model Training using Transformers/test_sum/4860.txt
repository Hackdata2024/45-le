In Sessions Case No. 26 of 1976, seven accused namely Sitarama @ Sitya, Sundera @ Sundarayya, Kishana @ Kishanayya, Gangarama @ Gangayya, Prakash, Vinayak and Shrirang were charged and tried together for offences under section 302 read with section 120B and also under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. Charge No. 1 was for criminal conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. on the allegation that between first week of October, 1975 and 2nd January, 1976 at Babultara and Waghala villages all the seven accused and the approver P.W. 1 entered into a criminal conspiracy to commit murders of young girls and women in the vicinity of Babultara village by injuring the victims or disfiguring their faces in order to make it appear that the accused in an earlier case called the Manwath murders case where 10 girls and women were murdered during the period from 14.11.1972 to 4.11.1974 in Manwath village were not the real culprits.
Charges 2 to 4 were framed under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. alleging that in furtherance of their common intention, accused 1 to 3 committed the murder of Ashamati on or about 10th November, 1975, accused 1 to 4 committed the murder of Parubai on or about 29th November, 1975 and accused 1, 6 and 7 committed the murder of Malan on or about 1st January, 1976.
The Sessions Judge on a consideration of the evidence acquitted all the seven accused under charge No. 1; all the accused under charges 2 and 3 and accused 7 under charge No. 4, but convicted accused 1 and 6 under charge No. 4 and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence accused 1 and 6 filed Criminal Appeal No. 7 of 1977 in the High Court of Bombay, while the State preferred Criminal Appeal No. 38 of 1977 for enhancement of the sentence awarded to them under section 377 Cr.
The State also preferred under section 378 Cr.
P.C. Criminal Appeal No. 605 of 1978 against the acquittal of accused 2, 34, 5 and 7 of charge No. 1 framed under section 302 read with section 120B.
There 780 being no further appeal by the State against acquittal; the acquittal of accused 1 and 6 of charge No. 1 and of accused 1 to 3 of charge No. 2 and of accused 1 to 4 of charge No. 3 became final.
The High Court considered the evidence, in the case, and dismissed Criminal Appeals Nos. 7 of 1977 and the connected Criminal State Appeal No. 38 of 1977 and thereby confirmed the conviction and the sentence awarded to accused Nos. 1 and 6.
The High Court, however accepted the State Appeal No. 605 of 1978 in part and convicted accused 5 and sentenced him to imprisonment for life under section 302 I.P.C. read with section 120B.
Hence the present appeals by accused 5 and 6 only, accused No. 1 not preferring an appeal.

The retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. and accused 5 was not a party for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused nos.
1, 6 and 7 were tried.

However, the conviction and sentence of imprisonment for life under section 302 read with section 341 I.P.C awarded to accused 6 is in order as there is sufficient evidence against him proving his guilt in respect of charge No. 4 framed regarding the murder of Malan beyond all reasonable doubt.
