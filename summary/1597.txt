The appellant company was a licensee for supplying elec.
tricity.
The State Electricity Board had by a notice intimated its intention to purchase the appellant 's undertaking on the expiry of its license.
Two days prior to the expiry of the licence the Industrial Court at Nagpur framed a scheme for payment of gratuity to the employees of the appellant company with effect from the date of the order.
On application by the appellant company under article 227 of the Constitution the High Court of Nagpur set aside the Industrial Court 's order and remanded the matter for the reconsideration.
After remand the Industrial Court came to the conclusion that the appellant company was in a position to pay gratuity and made a fresh award framing a scheme for payment of gratuity to its employees at the rate of 1 month 's average wage.
This award was made more than a year after the company had closed its business.
The present appeal is by way of special leave granted by this Court.
The main contention in the appeal was that the Tribunal was not justified in imposing on the company a gratuity scheme at a time when it had already ceased to carry on its business.
Held that the gratuity schemes are always made in the expectation of the industry continuing to function for a long time to come and hence the Industrial Court acted wrongly in framing any gratuity scheme for payment of gratuity by the company to its employees, Indian Hume Pipe Co. vs Its Workmen, and Bharatkhand Textile Mfg., Co., Ltd. vs Textile Labour Association, ; , distinguished.
