The workmen, however, objected to the introduction of the scheme and the dispute was referred by the Government to the Tribunal on December 13, 1957.
On December 16, the management of the companies put the rationalisation scheme into operation but the workmen refused to do the additional work placed on them by the scheme.
Later, the same day, the mills declared a lock out.
Work was, however, resumed a few days later as a result of a settlement, and a dispute arose as to whether the workmen were entitled to the payment of wages for the period during which the mills were closed: Held, (1) that the workmen 's representatives on the Works Committee represented the workmen only for the purpose of the functions of the Works Committee and that the approval of the scheme of rationalisation by the Works Committee was not binding on the workmen or their Union.
Kemp and Company Ltd. vs Their Workmen, , approved.
(2) that the introduction of a rationalisation scheme was an alteration of conditions of service to the prejudice of the workmen.
(3) that the alteration of conditions of service was made not when notice under section 9A of the was given but on December 16, when the rationalisation scheme was put into operation, and that as it was done when the reference was pending before the Tribunal, it was a contravention of section 33 of the Act.
(4) that the closure of the mills in the circumstances of this case by the employer amounted to an illegal lock out and that the workmen unable to work in consequence of the lock out were entitled to wages for the period of absence caused by such lock out.
