Under ss.4 and 5 of the Assam Municipal Act, 1923, the Provincial Government was authorised to signify its intention to include within a municipality any local area in its vicinity, and, after considering.
any objections to the proposed action to so include the area.
Section 328 provided for the constitution of notified areas.
Sections 4 and 5 were not applicable to a notified area but the Provincial Government could extend to any notified area any section of the Act by virtue of section 330(1)(d).
Under section 330(3), for the purpose of any section so extended, the town committee constituted for such notified area would be deemed to be a Municipal Board.
In 1957, the 1923 Act was repealed and was replaced by the Assam Municipal Act, 1957.
The respondent owned tea gardens in the village of Nazira.
In 1909, a town committee was constituted at Nazira adjacent to the tea garden.
In 1951, by a notification issued by the Government of Assam, s.4(1)(b) and (c), and s.5(1) and (2)(b) of the 1923 Act were extended to the notified area committee including the Nazira Town Committee.
On January 6, 1964, a notification was issued under the 1957Act to revise the boundaries of the notified area at Nazira, and after considering the objections of the respondent on September 30, 1964, by a final notification, a part of its tea estate was incorporated within the Nazira Town Committee.
On the question whether notifications dated January 6, 1964 and September 30, 1964 were unauthorised, because, sections 4 and 5 of 1957 Act, corresponding to sections 4 and 5 of the 1923 Act, were not extended to the notified area on these dates, HELD : There is no express provision in the 1957 Act which supersedes the notification issued in 1951 under the 1923 Act nor is the continuance of the notification inconsistent with any provision in the 1957 Act.
Therefore, under section 26 of the Assam General Clauses Art, 1915, the 1951 notification continues in force and must be deemed to have been issued under the 1957 Act.
Hence, the State Government was competent, in exercise of the power conferred upon it by the 1957 Act, to include within the area of the Town Committee any local area contiguous to it.
