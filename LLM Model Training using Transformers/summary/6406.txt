The subject matter of the Writ Petition is the gradation list dated 9.1.1986 of the Inspectors of Excise by which the Government of Bihar has finally fixed the inter se seniority of the Petitioners who were promoted vis a vis the appel lants in the present appeal who were promoted to posts of Inspectors of Excise in 5% quota reserved for promotion from the posts of Upper Division Assistants of Excise Department.
In the gradation list the appellants who joined as Inspectors of Excise on 7.5.76 were shown as senior to the Excise Inspector who were promoted from Sub Inspectors on 24.4.74 in the vacancies of direct recruits.
The gradation list was challenged in the High Court by the Respondents on two grounds i.e., (1) the State Govern ment has no jurisdiction to determine the seniority or gradation list of the Excise Inspectors, the competent authority is the Excise Commissioner (2) The Respondents in the present appeal have been continuously officiated for years together in the vacancies of direct recruits and thus could not be pushed down for determining the seniority and shown as juniors to the contesting appellants.
The High Court allowed the Writ Petition in part.
It was held that 5% quota to be filled up by promotion from Upper Division Assistants of Excise Department was notified only on 31st March 1975, whereas the appellants have been promot ed in the 5% quota of vacancies of the year 1974 75.
Hence they have not been promoted in the 5% quota.
The Respondents in the present appeal were promoted as Excise Inspectors on 24.4.74 in the quota of direct recruits and thus they could not be shown as juniors to those who were promoted and joined on 7.5.76 from 5% quota of the 1974 75 year vacan cies.
The High Court quashed the 194 gradation list and directed the State Government to draw up a fresh list in the light of the observations made.
Further it held that State Government is the competent authority to determine inter se seniority because where in any provisions of Bihar Excise Act 1915 government has vested the Excise Commissioner with the power of determining the seniority of the Excise Inspectors.
Hence the gradation list prepared by the State Government is legal and valid.
The appellants filed Special Leave petition in this Court against the High Court Judgment and Order.
Allowing the Special Leave Petition, this Court, HELD: The appellants claimed to be promoted to the posts of Inspectors in the 5% quota set apart for promotion from the Upper Division Assistants against the vacancies of the year 1974 75.
Since under Bihar Excise Act 1915 vide notifi cation No. 417 of 15.1.1919 clause (iv) the Excise Commis sioner was given only the powers to appoint Excise Inspec tors by promotions but not to determine inter se seniority etc.
Hence vide Excise Recruitment Rules 1936, Rule No. I vide notification No. 411 dated 31.3.75, after clause (2) clause (3) was added making provision for promotion from selected confirmed Upper Division Assistants and Head Clerks of the District Excise Office and also added at the end of the Rule 1 that at least 5% of the total vacancies shall be filled up by promotion from among the above notified staff.
In this rule the provision for relaxation of direct recruit ment quota was made but there was no relaxation of the quota of promotees.
[197G; 198C; 199E] The State Government made this decision and order on 20.3.74 regarding reservation of 5% of the total vacancies to be filled by promotion for the year 1974 75 but the notification to that effect was published on 31.3.75.
The promotion could not have been given unless the decision was confirmed by notification.
It was only after the notifica tion of 31.3.75, that the Upper Division Assistants were promoted as Excise Inspectors for the first time out of the 5% quota created in the vacancies of 1974 75, in the year 1976.
[205G H; 206B] The Government has rightly promoted the appellants within their quota in the vacancies occurred in 1974 by its orders.
[211D] When there is no relaxation in the quota vacancies as between the direct recruitment and promotees, the determina tion of inter se 195 seniority shall be determined in the order of rotation of vacancies reserved for both categories, the direct recruits made within their quota would always deemed to be senior to those promotees recruited inexcess of their quota.

, ; , relied on.
It is only when the quota rule was not adhered to or followed for a long time and the promotees are allowed to officiate in the quota of direct recruits for a period of 15 to 20 years, in such circumstances Government is empowered to relax the quota rule and the promotees will have seniori ty from the date of the continuous officiations in the cadre, grade or service.

, ; Quotas are fixed under the relevant rules of recruit ments and can be altered only by fresh determination of quotas under the relevant rules of recruitments.
[201 C] In the instant case, there was no rule for relaxation of the quota.
The respondent Nos. 3 & 4 who were promoted from selected Excise Sub Inspectors to the Inspectors of Excise in 1974, officiated till 7.5.
1976 when the appellants joined as Inspectors of Excise from their 5% quota.
It cannot be said in such circumstances that the quota was not filled up for a long period nor can it be said that the respondents 3 & 4 who were promoted in excess of their quota have worked as inspectors of Excise for long time and as such the respondents 3 & 4 cannot claim to be seniors to the appellants.
[210G H; 211A] The appellants being promoted as Inspectors of Excise from the 5% quota of vacancies of the year 1974 75, were rightly shown as seniors.
in the gradation list prepared by the Government on 9.1.1986 which is legal and valid.
