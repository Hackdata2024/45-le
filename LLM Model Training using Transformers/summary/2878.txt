The appellant is a manufacturer of certain medicines with the aid of substances like tincture, spirit, etc., which contain alcohol.
On the question whether he was liable to pay duty under the Medicinal and Toilet Preparation (Excise Duties) Act, 1955, HELD : (1) The preparations are proprietary medicinal preparations and are not capable of being consumed as ordinary alcohol beverages, According to Item 1 of the Schedule to the Act, in order to attract duty, all that is required is that the medicinal preparation should contain alcohol.
Alcohol may be a part of the preparation either because it is directly added to the solution or it came to be included in the medicinal preparation because one of its components contains alcohol.
[592 E G] (2)It may be that a tincture is dutiable under the item, and, when the medicinal preparation in which it was used is also made dutiable it will involve multi point taxation.
But section 4 of the Act shows that the multi point tax on medicinal preparations containing alcohol was within the contemplation of the Legislature.
That section provides for rebate of duty on alcohol supplied to the manufacturer of dutiable goods, and, every rebate pressupposes imposition of tax or duty.
[593 B F] (3) The rebate under section 4 is confined only to those goods which directly come within the scope of section 4 and not to others.
From such a provision it cannot be said that as regard the other medicinal preparations, there can be no levy when the language of the provision imposing the levy is plain and unambiguous.
