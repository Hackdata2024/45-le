The appellant was the administrator of the estate of one Henry Gannon, a resident of British India, who left for the United Kingdom in 1944 and died there in 1945.
In the course of administration the appellant sold certain shares and securities belonging to the deceased for the purpose of distributing the assets amongst the legatees and thereby realised more than their cost prime.
The excess of sale price over the cost price was treated by the Income tax Officer as capital gain under section 12 B 168 of the Income tax Act and the appellant was assessed to tax on such capital gain for the assessment years 1947 48 and 1948 49.
The appellant contended that there had been a distribution of capital assets by him under the will of Henry Gannon and therefore he came under the protection of the third proviso to section 12B(1) and was not liable to tax.
Held, that the appellant was not protected by the third proviso to section 12B(1) as the expression " distribution of capital assets " in that proviso meant distribution in specie and not distribution of sale proceeds of the capital assets.
So long as there was distribution of the capital assets in specie and there was no sale, there was no transfer for the purposes of section 12B, but as soon as there was a sale of the capital assets and profits or gains arose therefrom, the liability to tax also arose, whether the sale was by the administrator or by the legate.
