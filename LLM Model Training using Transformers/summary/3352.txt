The appellant 's tender for mining rights for mica was accepted in 1951.
The appellant deposited the premium demanded and took possession of the land.
The lease was for a period of twenty years but no lease was executed.
In 1967, the State Government directed that the appellant should vacate the land within a month from the date of the receipt of their order.
The appellant challenged the order under article 226.
but the High Court dismissed the petition.
Allowing the appeal to this Court, ^ HELD: (1) In view of the facts, that the period of the purported lease had already expired, and no proper lease had been executed, there was no question of issuing a writ for granting the lease, or the appellant exercising an option to renew the lease.
[224H] (2) The appellant, however, was entitled to a refund of the illegally realised premium deducting the sum received on account of compensation for the unexpired period.
The State Government was under a legal obligation to act in accordance with the statutory rules applicable, namely, the Mineral Concession Rules, 1949, made in exercise of the power conferred under section 5 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 when granting a lease.
It could not impose terms and conditions according to its own whims ignoring or disregarding statutory rules which are binding on it, and could not exercise a power unknown to the rules.
There is no provision in the rules authorising the realisation of premium.
Rule 41, providing for conditions of the lease, specifically mentions royalty, dead rent and surface rent but not premium.
Under r. 41(3) a mining lease may contain any other special conditions subject to the prior approval of the Central Government; but no such prior approval was given in the present case, for the realisation of the premium.
