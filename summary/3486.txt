"Bane lands" are forest lands granted for the service of the "Warg", holding rice fields to which they are allotted to be held, free of revenue, for grazing, leaf manure/firewood and for timber required in the Warg, capable of being alienated only along with the Warg lands u/s 97 of the Coorg Land and Revenue Regulation 1899, which is in pari materia with Rule 151 A and B made under the Indian Forest Rules 1954.
The holders of the Bane Land had the right to redeem the trees standing on such Bane lands subject to the payment of seignorage etc.
Under Rule 137 of the Karnataka Forest Rules 1969, effective from 1st March 1969, redemption of the growth on "Bane lands" was allowed on payment of 50% of the value of the timber.
Rule 137 was however deleted w.e.f. 15th January 1974.
The various appellants who were holders of "Bane Lands" challenged, under article 226.
the orders of the Forest authorities demanding full value of the timber sought to be "redeemed" by them contending that (i) they had vested right to redeem the trees on Bane lands on payment of 50% of the value of timber under the Coorg Land and Revenue Regulations of 1899 and (ii) Section 75 of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964 vested in them an absolute right in respect of the trees on Bane lands and the Government therefore had no right even to demand 50% of the value.
All the writs were accepted by the Mysore High Court following its earlier decision in I.L.R. (Karnataka) 1975 Vol. 25, p. 443 (Ramaraju Naidu vs Divl.
Forest officer) holding that the Rules conferred a right on the holders of Bane lands to redeem the trees standing on such lands on payment of 50% of the value of the timber to the State along with other incidental charges.
The court did not express any opinion whether the State had no right to demand 50% of the value under the Karnataka and Revenue Act of 1964.
Allowing the State appeal against I.L.R. (Karnataka) 1975 Vol.
25 page 443 the Division Bench held [in State of Karnataka vs Ramaraju Naidu I.L.R. (Karnataka) 1975 Vol.
25 p. 1361] that (i) the Bane holders had no propriety right to the soil of Bane Land and to the trees standing thereon but only limited privilege to collect grass leaves timber etc.
for domestic purposes (ii) Even after section 75(1) of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act was enacted the Bane holders did not become holders or occupants as defined in the Act and ownership of trees did not accrue to them and (iii) Section 79 of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act which preserved the preexisting privileges of Bane holders has no application to Bane lands.
Keeping 15 1 74, the date of deletion of Rule 137 of the Karnataka Forest Rules 1969, the Division Bench, however directed that (1) the respondents who deposited before 15th January 1974, 50% of the value of timber as determined by the Forest officer could be granted permits to cut and remove timber, with liberty to the Forest officer to recover and any differential amount between the 50% of the actual value of timber and amount paid on the basis of prior determination and (ii) those respondents who have made applications under rule 137 before 15th January 1974, but not deposited the amount could also be granted permits on deposit of 50% of the value of timber.
Dismissing the State appeals, by certificate, the court ^ HELD: (1) The learned single judge in ILR (Karnataka) 1975 Vol.
25 p. 443 rightly did not express any view on the second question as to whether 1089 the Bane Land holders could ask for removal of trees without payment full of value u/s 75 of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964.
[1091A] Ramaraju Naidu vs Divl.
Forest Officer I.L.R. (Karnataka) 1975, Vol.
25 p. 443 (partly affirmed).
(ii) The directions given by the Division Bench are explicable because of 15th January 1974 being taken as the dividing line with regard to persons who made payments and persons who did not make payment consequent upon the repeal of Rule 137 of the Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969.
[109lF] [Their Lordships left open to the parties to urge their rival contentions on the questions of the nature and terms of Bane lands and right, if in future, there will be any dispute between them, in view of their making clear that the observations and opinions of the High Court Division Bench should not operate as res judicata]
