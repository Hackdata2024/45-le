The respondent landlord filed a petition for eviction of the appellant, under section 14A read with section 25B of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 on the ground of requirement for personal occupation, in view of the fact that he was forced to pay penal rent of Rs. 1,448 from his Government accommodation as per Government of India notification dated 9 9 1975 and the special order dated 22 1 1976 requiring him to vacate the Government accommodation by 31 12 1975.
After presentation of the eviction petition and service of notice under section 25B of the Act, the appellant filed a petition for grant of leave to defend the main petition and raised several objections in the written statement.
One such objection was that in view of the later circular of the Government dated 14 7 1977, the respondent was not required to vacate the Government accommodation and, therefore, he was not entitled to evict the appellants under the provisions of section 14A of the Delhi Rent Control Act.
The said objection having been disallowed by the Additional Rent Controller the appellant filed Civil Revision Petition before the Delhi High Court, which met with the same fate.
Hence the appeal against that order by special leave.
Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: 1.
The respondent landlord is entitled to have recourse to section 14A of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 for evicting the appellants from the premises in question.
