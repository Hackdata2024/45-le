The assessee, a Hindu undivided family, owned a tea estate in Assam comprising a tea garden, factories, labour, quarters, staff quarters etc.
On February 27, 1942, the military authorities requisitioned all the factory buildings etc., under the Defence of India Rules but the tea garden, however, was left in the possession of the assessee.
The possession of the military continued till the year 1945 and during that period, though the assessee looked after its tea garden, its business as tea growers and tea manufacturers could not be continued.
Under the Defence of India Rules, the military authorities paid the assessee as compensation a sum of Rs. 2,22,080 for the year 1944, which included Rs. 10,000 for repairs to quarters for labourers, and a sum of Rs. 2,46,794 for the year 1945, which included Rs. 15,231 for repairs.
For the assessment years 1945 1946 and 1946 47 the question arose as to whether the aforesaid sums or any portion thereof were capital receipts or were revenue receipts and liable to tax.
The facts showed that the business, which the assessee had been carrying on, consisted in growing tea plants and in making tea out of the leaves by a manufacturing process into a commercial commodity, that without the factory and the premises the tea leaves could not be dried, smoked and cured to become tea, and that the result of the requisition of the factories was to stop the business.
Held, that the amounts paid by the military authorities were received by the assessee not as compensation for the loss of profits of the business which it had been carrying on but for the injury to the business as a whole, because the entire structure of business was affected to such an extent that no business was carried on by the assessee during the two years in question.
Accordingly, the compensation could not bear the character of profits of a business and was not liable to tax under section Io of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922.
