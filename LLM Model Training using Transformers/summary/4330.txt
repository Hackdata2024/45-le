Dismissing the defendant 's appeal and affirming the decree in favour of the plaintiffs, the Court. ^ HELD: A presumption of truth attaches to the entries in the Jamabandi for the year 1959 60 showing the defendant respondents as a tenant, in view of the provisions of Section 44 of the Punjab Land Revenue Act.
That presumption is no doubt rebuttable, but, in the instant case, no attempt has been made to displace it.
[407C D] Further, once that presumption is raised, still another comes to the aid of respondent No. 1 by reason of the rule contained in Section 109 of the Indian Evidence Act, namely, that when two persons have been shown to stand to each other in the relationship of landlord and tenant, the burden of proving that such relationship has ceased, is on the party who so asserts.
It may, therefore, be legitimately presumed that the plaintiff continued to possess the land as a tenant till the institution of the suit.
