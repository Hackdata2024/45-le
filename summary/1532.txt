The respondents who were citizens of India left India for Pakistan sometime after January 26, 1950.
They returned to India in 1956 on the strength of a Pakistani passport and visa.
They continued to stay in India even after the period of the visa had expired and were prosecuted under section 14 , read with cl. 7 Foreigner 's Order, 1948, for unauthorised and illegal overstay in India.
The High Court acquitted them holding that they had not become foreigners on.account of their leaving India after January 26, 1950, and the question whether they had lost their Indian citizenship on account of acquisition of Pakistani citizenship could not be agitated before a court of law.
The appellant contended that in view of article 7 of the Constitution the respondents could 430 not be deemed to be citizens of India as they had migrated to Pakistan after March 1, 1947, within the meaning of article 7.
Held, that article 7 was applicable only to persons who had migrated to Pakistan between March 1, 1947, and January 26, 1950, and under this Article the respondents had not ceased to be citizens of India.
The words "has migrated" in article 7 could not include cases of persons who would migrate after the commencement of the Constitution, they refer only to persons who had migrated at the date when the Constitution came into force.
The absence of the words "at the commencement of the Constitution" in article 7 has no significance.
Cases of acquisition of foreign citizenship after January 26, 1950, were covered by the provisions of the , and of the rules made thereunder.
The Central Government or its delegate was the appropriate authority to deal with such questions and they could not be tried in courts.
