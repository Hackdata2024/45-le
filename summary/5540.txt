% Under an agreement of sale entered into by respondents the appellant had paid the major portion of the agreed price long time ago and the balance thereof that was to be paid at the time of execution of the documents was a sum of Rs. 75 only.
Possession of the premises was with the appellant for all these years in part performance of the agreement.
Upon failure of the respondents to execute documents of title, the appellant sought specific performance of the agreement.
The respondents canvassed the question of limitation before the High Court.
The High Court, however, without deciding that question took the view that due to passage of time prices of lands had gone up sky high and it would be unjust to enforce the agreement of sale.
Allowing the appeal by special leave, ^ HELD: The High Court exercised discretion on wrong principles.
Without deciding the question whether the claim of the plaintiff was barred by limitation or not it proceeded to refuse to grant the relief on the ground that there has been good deal of delay and the parties would suffer if specific performance of the agreement was granted.
This principle was not applicable to the facts of the case and the exercise of discretion was not proper.
The matter remanded to the High Court for decision in merits.
