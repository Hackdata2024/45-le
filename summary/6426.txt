Paragraph 516 B of the Punjab Jail Manual provides for premature release of prisoners, and is in the nature of executive instructions.
The State Government modified the instructions in 1971 and 1976.
The 1976 instruction was to the effect that cases of life convicts whose sentence has been commuted should be considered for premature release only after completion of 14 years of actual imprisonment.
The State Government further liberalised its policy and decided that such cases might be reviewed by a state level committee and directed that cases of life convicts who have completed 8 1/2 years substantive sentence and sentence of 14/10 years including remission be submitted to the Commit tee.
Later on the State Government clarified that the lib eralised policy would not be applicable to the life convicts whose death sentence has been commuted to life imprisonment.
In 1978, the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 was amended introducing section 433A providing that such life convicts should undergo actual imprisonment of 14 years in jail.
This Court declared that section 433A of the Code is prospective in effect and did not operate against those cases which were decided by the trial court before 18.12.1978 (Maru Ram etc.
vs Union of India and Anr.
, ; The cases of respondents were in fact covered by the said decision.
432 They have filed writ petitions before the High Court for premature release and the High Court directed the State Government to consider their cases.
The State Government has .,preferred these appeals, by special leave, against the orders of the High Court.
Dismissing the appeals, this Court, HELD: 1.1.
No one has got a vested right to claim pre mature release on the ground that he has suffered the mini mum actual imprisonment as prescribed under section 433A Cr.
P.C. because a sentence of 'imprisonment for life ' is incarceration until death, that is, for the remaining period of convicted person 's actual life.
There is no question of releasing such a lifer early in the absence of an order of commutation under section 55 IPC by the appropriate Govern ment, or under section 433(b) of Criminal Procedure Code of 1973 by the appropriate Government or on a clemency order in exercise of power under Article 72 or 161 of the Constitu tion of India.
[435E F; G H] 1.2.
In the instant case, the conviction of the respond ents was recorded early to the introduction of section 433A and, therefore, as per the ratio laid down in Maru Ram 's case, the two respondents are entitled for consideration of release by the appropriate Government as per the prevailing rules or executive instructions.
Further, admittedly, the State Government did not take up the cases of the respond ents for premature release within six months of the order of this Court dated 10th December 1980 in Sant Ram 's case, (W.P. Nos.
1252 64/80 etc.
etc.) and deferred the considera tion of premature release till the respondents had completed 14 years of substantive sentence.
It has become obligatory for the State to consider the cases of premature release of the respondents in accordance with the rules or executive instructions prevailing and applicable to them at the rele vant time i.e. between the period 10.12.1980 and 9.6.1981.
The plea of the appellant that the premature release of the respondents was not considered since they have not completed 14 years of substantive imprisonment is in violation of the directions of the order dated 10th December, 1980 of this Court and so the appellant cannot be permitted to make such a plea on the strength of the executive instructions over looking and ignoring the above directions.
There is no infirmity in the judgments of the High Court calling for interference.
