The respondents as plaintiffs brought the suit, out of which the present appeal arises, under the provisions of 0. 21, r. 63 Of the Code of Civil Procedure for a declaration that the deed of trust executed in favour of the appellant deity was a sham and fictitious document and the properties covered by it were liable to sold in execution of their decree.
The courts below dismissed the suit but the High Court, by misplacing the onus on the deity to prove its title, set aside the concurrent findings, of the Courts below and decreed the respondents ' suit.
Held, that the question whether a trust deed was a fictitious document or not was essentially a question of fact.
Meenakshi Mills, Madurai vs The Commissioner of Income tax, Madras, ; , referred to.
It was well settled by a long series of decisions of the Privy Council and of this Court that the High Court could not, in a second appeal, interfere with findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below" however erroneous they might be.
Even assuming that it was open to the High Court to go behind the findings of fact, it was clear that it had completely misdirected itself on the question of onus.
In a suit, such as the present, where the plaintiff sought for a declaration that a document solemnly executed and registered was a fictitious one, the burden lay heavily on him to prove that it was so and that burden became still more heavy where he sought a declaration that an order passed by the court upholding a claim of a third party under 0. 21, r. 60 of the Code was erroneous.
