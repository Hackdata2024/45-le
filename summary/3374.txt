In respect of an area of 8.36 acres of land containing limestone in the village Bistara, Jabalpur District, there were two applications before the State Government (Respondent in C.A. 785/71 & Appellant in C.A. 1781/75) empowered to grant prospecting licence or a mining lease for a major mineral under the Mineral Concessions Rules, 1960 or a "quarry lease" under the Madhya Pradesh Mineral Rules, 1961, for a minor mineral as defined in section 3(e) of the one by "GD", (the appellant in C.A. 785/71 and respondent in C.A. 1781/75) dated 7 5 1965 for a quarry lease for "limestone for burning purposes, minor minerals intended" and another by "RC" dated 2 6 1965 for a mining lease for "a major mineral".
The "quarry lease" was granted to "GD" on 1 11 1965 and the lease deed was executed on 10 11 1965 with a special clause 18A therein.
In revision by "RC" against the order granting quarry lease to GD the Central Government by its order dated 14 12 1967, holding that in substance the application of "GD" was an application for "major mineral" and, there fore.
the grant of the "quarry lease" to the appellant was not competent, directed the respondent State to consider the application of "RD" for the grant of mining lease.
As the writ petition No. 3/68 assailing the said order, filed by "GD" in the M.P. High Court was dismissed on 2 9 1970, GD obtained a special leave (CA 785/71), but the stay was refused, resulting in his lease running in operation only for a period of about 5 years and "RD" carrying on its operation of mining limestone as a major mineral.
During the pendency of the lease in favour of "GD" the rate of royalty was enhanced by the State Government and "GD" filed another writ petition (MP No. 328/1968) in the High Court on 23 7 1968.
As the MP 3/68 Was dismissed on 2 9 1970, "GD" amended the application suitable in MP 328/68 with the words "in view of the decision of the High Court, he was liable to pay royalty at a rate which were chargeable as a major mineral".
The High Court allowed the writ petition, remanded the matter of qualification of the amount of royalty due from "GD".
After the remand, the State Government determined the royalty at Rs. 16,722/ .
The said demand was again 877 challenged by "GD" for the third time by way of a writ petition No. MP 390/72 contending that if royalty was charged from him on the basis of a major mineral, then he had paid Rs. 36,000/ and odd more.
The writ was allowed in 25 3 1974 during the course of the hearing of CA 785/71 in the Supreme Court and the appeal by special leave (CA 1781/75) obtained by the respondent State against the order dated 25 3 1974 was heard with CA 785/71.
Allowing CA 785/71 on merits, following the decision in Rukmani Bai Gupta vs The State Government of Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal and others; , and allowing CA 1781/75 with permission to the appellant to withdraw the writ petitions No MP 328/68 and MP 390/72, the Court: ^ HELD: (1) The facts of the instant case, being almost identical as Smt.
Rukmani Bai Gupta 's case, with the only difference that in column 6 of his application the present appellant had merely stated "minor minerals" reading the said expression with the expression "limestone for burning purposes" mentioned in paragraph 1, the same result follows.
Therefore, the application of the appellant was for a minor mineral and the lease granted to him was for the same.
After the adverse decision of the High Court, he was ill advised to take the stand that he was liable to pay royalty on the amount of limestone quarried by him out as "a major mineral", that the amount of royalty which is chargeable upon it as "a major mineral" is lower than one chargeable upon it as a "minor mineral".

Rukmani Bai Gupta vs The State Government of Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal and others.
; , followed.
HELD FURTHER: (2) The distinctive points between the 1958 and 1961 notifications are as under: (a) Limestone for lime burning was a 'minor mineral" under the 1958 notification irrespective of the process of burning or the quality of the lime it produced.
[882 C] (b) After the 1961 notification only that type of limesone would be a "minor mineral" which is capable or being used for burning in kilns for producing has quality of lime which can ordinarily and generally be used as a building material.
[882 D] (c) The lessees ' responsibility ceases when the limestone quarried by him is used for burning kilns producing the building material quality of lime.
It would be beyond his control to see that the lime so produced was actually used as a building material.
(3) The question of grant of a lease for quarrying or mining the limestone will have to be decided by the State Government on the basis of the quality of the limestone in a particular area.
If a major portion in the area is such that can be used as a "minor mineral" then a lease in accordance with the State Rules will have to be granted and a special clause like clause 18 may be provided therein if per chance some quality of limestone quarried in the demised area is found to be of high grade.
Similarly if the major portion is found to be of high grade limestone, then a mining lease for mining limestone as a major mineral in accordance with the Central Rules will have to be granted.
A special clause may be incorporated in such a lease also.
In either event the lease will be liable to be cancelled if the lessee commits any breach of the terms of the lease including the one as to the purpose of using the limestone as a major or a minor mineral.[882 EH] (4) In situations like the instant case where there were two applicants one wanting the lease of limestone as a minor mineral and the other who wanted it as a major mineral, it was not open to the State Government to merely ignore the application for major mineral and grant lease to the appellant; nor was it appropriate for the Central Government to direct the State Government to consider the application for major mineral.
The proper course in such a situation is to direct the State Government to consider both the applications, determine the question as to whether the quality of the limesone contained in the area in question is such that a lease to quarry it as a minor mineral should 878 be granted and then it should proceed to grant the leave.
In the instant case the proper course which ought to have been followed has neither been followed nor has been directed to be followed by the Central Government.
