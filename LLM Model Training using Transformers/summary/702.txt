6 of section 10 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922: "A trade, professional or similar association performing specific services for its members for remuneration definitely related to those services shall be deemed for the purpose of this section to carry on business in respect of those services, and the profits and gains therefrom shall be liable to tax accordingly.
" The members of the respondent company, whose principal object was to facilitate the transaction of business on the Stock Exchange, were enabled under the by laws to have a certain number of Authorised Assistants so that the latter could use the premises of the company and transact business therein in the names and on behalf of the members who, for that purpose, were required to pay admission fees and monthly subscriptions in respect of each of them.
The by laws of the company also provided that no dealings in respect of the shares of any particular company should be permitted on the Stock Exchange, unless an application made by a member of the respondent company and accompanied by a fee of Rs. 1000, for putting the name of that company on the Quotations List was approved by the prescribed Authority of the respondent company.
During the accounting year in question the company received from its members admission fees and subscriptions in respect of the Authorized Assistants and fees for putting the names of companies on the Quotations List.
The question was whether the aforesaid amount was liable to be taxed under section 10(6) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922.
Held, that with reference to a trade, professional or similar association, the performing of specific services under section 10(6) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, mean conferring on its members some tangible benefit which otherwise would not be available to them as such, except for payment received by the association in respect of those services.
460 Accordingly, the income received by the respondent company towards the admission fees and the subscriptions in respect of the Authorized Assistants, being the price paid for the services of the respondent company in making suitable arrangements for an absentee member to transact business on his behalf and in his name by his representative or agent within the Stock Exchange, as well as the fees received from members for enlisting the names of companies not already on the Quotations List so as to permit transactions in respect of the shares of the companies concerned, was remuneration definitely related to specific services performed by the respondent for its members within the meaning of s.10(6) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, and was assessable to income tax.
