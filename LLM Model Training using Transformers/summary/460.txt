The labourers were being paid the basic wages of as.
8/ for male labourers and as.
6/ for female labourers for the work load or task of plucking 16 seers and 12 seers of green tea leaves respectively each day.
If the labourers plucked larger quantities of leaves they were paid extra wages at the rate of 6 Ps.
per seer in excess of 16 seers and 12 seers respectively.
The Government issued a notification under section 3 read with section 5 (2) of the , increasing the rates of basic wages to as.
I2/and as.
11/ respectively.
The management thereafter refused to make any extra payment to the labourers at the rate of 6 Ps.
per seer unless the leaves plucked by them exceeded 24 seers and 22 seers respectively.
Held, that the sole intention of the Government in issuing the notification was to increase the basic wages while maintaining the same basic work load or task assigned to the labourers, so that whatever extra work was done by the labourers in excess of the existing work load or task of plucking 16 seers and 12 seers of tea leaves by the male and female labourers respectively, bad still to be paid for at the rate of 6 Ps.
per seer.
Quaere: Whether the claim for the extra wages amounts to a claim arising out of the payment of less than the minimum rates of wages within the meaning of section 20 (2) of the .
A writ of certiorari cannot be had as a matter of course.
The High Court is entitled to refuse the writ if it is satisfied that there was no failure of justice.
The Supreme Court declines to interfere, in appeal, with the discretion of the High Court unless it is satisfied that the justice of the case requires such interference.
