The respondent who was a former Captain of the Indian Army and was employed in the delegation in India of a French Company was prosecuted along with two others for conspiracy and passing on Official Secrets to a foreign agency under ss.3 and 5 of the Official Secrets Act.
His application for bail was rejected by the Sessions judge but the High Court allowed bail on the ground inter alia that his case might fall only under s.5 which was bailable and not section 3 which was not bailable.
It did not express any opinion whether the case fell under section 5 or section 3 in view of the commitment proceedings which were going on at the time.
On appeal by the State.
Held, that the High Court should have proceeded to deal with the application for bail on the assumption that the offence was under section 3 and therefore not bailable.
It should have then taken into account the various considerations such as, nature and seriousness of the offence, the character of the evidence circumstances peculiar to the accused, possibility of his absconding, tampering with witnesses larger interests of the public.
and the State and similar other considerations Which arise When bail is asked for in a non bailable offence.
The fact that the applicant for bail might not abscond was not by itself a sufficient ground for granting bail.
