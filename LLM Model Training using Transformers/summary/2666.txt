Sub section (3) of section 23 provides that no direction for the inclusion of name in the electoral roll of a constituency shall be given after the last date for making nomination for an election in that constituency and before the completion of that election.
The appellant 's election to the Bihar Legislative Council was challenged on the ground that some of the votes cast in his favour were not valid because the names of the voters were included in the electoral roll after the last date for filing nomination.
The High Court set aside the election and declared the second respondent elected since on counting the validly cast votes the second respondent secured more votes than the appellant.
On the question whether it was within the competence of the electoral registration officer to amend the electoral rolls after the last date for making the nomination was over, HELD: The legislative mandate like the one embodied in section 23 sub section
(3) must be considered as mandatory not merely because of the language employed in that sub section but also in view of the purpose behind the provision.
The sub section does not deal with any mode or procedure in the matter off registering the voters.
It interdicts the concerned officers from interfering with the electoral rolls under the prescribed circumstances.
It puts a stop to the power conferred on them.
Therefore it is not a question of irregular exercise of power but a lack of power.
[842 D.F.] There is no conflict between sub section (2) of section 23 and subs.
(2) of section 27 because a fair reading of the various clauses in section 27(2) will make it clear that it is the electoral roll of a constituency as it stood on the last date for making the nominations for an election in that constituency that is to be considered final for the purpose of that election.
