With a view to give protection to Thika tenants against eviction and in certain other matters, the West Bengal Legislature enacted the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949.
That Act was amended by the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Amendment Act, 1953, which omitted section 28 of the Act.
The question for decision in the appeal was whether the appellant against whom proceedings for execution of a decree for ejectment was pending, who had applied for relief under section 28 when that section was in force, was entitled to have his application disposed of in accordance with the provisions of section 28, which had ceased to exist retrospectively though it remained undisposed of on the date the Amendment Act came into force: Held, that section 1, sub section
(2) of the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act 1953, clearly intended that no relief under section 28 of the original 579 Act should be given in cases pending for disposal on the date the amendment became effective and section 28 ceased to exist retrospectively.
The principles applicable to interpretation of statutes are four fold in nature, (1)such statutory provisions as create or take away substantive rights are ordinarily prospective ; they can be retrospective if made so expressly or by necessary implication and the retrospective operation must be limited only to the extent to which it has been so made either expressly or by necessary implication, (2)the intention of the legislature has to be gathered from the words used by it, giving them their plain, normal, grammatical meaning, (3)if any provision of a legislation the purpose of which is to benefit a particular class of persons is ambiguous so that it is capable of two meanings the meaning which preserves the benefit should be adopted.
, (4)If the strict grammatical interpretation gives rise to an absurdity or inconsistency, such interpretation should be discarded and an interpretation which will give effect to the purpose will be put on the words, if necessary, even by modification of the language used: Held, also, that judicial decorum ought never to be ignored.
Where one Division Bench or a judge of a High Court is unable to distinguish a previous decision of another Division Bench or another Single judge and holds the view that the earlier decision was wrong, the matter should be referred to a larger Bench to avoid utter confusion.
