The respondent as head of a joint Hindu family owned a re rolling mill at which scrap iron locally purchased, and iron plate , imported from outside, were converted into bars, flats and plates in the Mills and thereafter sold in the market.
The sales tax authorities held that iron bars, flats and plates sold by the respondent were not 'iron and steel ' exempted by notification No. 58 dated October 1953 issued under the Essential Goods (Declaration and Regulation of Sales and Purchasees) Act, 1952.
In a petition under articles 226 and 227 filed by the respondent challenging the said assessment the High Court decided that iron bars, flats and plates were exempted under the notification.
The State appealed to this Court.
HELD : Goods prepared from metals other than gold and silver are made taxable by notification No. 59 whereas notification No. 58 exempts iron and steel from tax.
A comparison of the said two notifications brings out the distinction between raw materials of iron and steel and the goods prepared from iron and steel.
While the former is exempted from tax the latter is taxed.
Therefore iron and steel used as rawmaterial for manufacturing other goods are exempted from taxation.
So long as iron and steel continue to be raw materials, they enjoy the exemption.
Scrap iron purchased by the respondent was merely rerolled into bars, flats and plates for convenience of sale.
The rawmaterials were only re rolled to give them attractive and acceptable forms.
They did not in the process lose their character as iron and steel.
The bars, flats and plates sold by the respondent were therefore iron and steel exempt under the notification.
