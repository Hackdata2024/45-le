The petitioners who had served the respondent Corpora tion for long periods on daily wage basis prayed for regu larisation of services and grant of time scale pay from their dates of initial appointment on the ground that others similarly placed had been granted these benefits.
The Court, after noticing that there were discrepancies in the factual position adopted by the parties, DIRECTED: The matter to be examined is with reference to factual position as to when the 19 persons in Annexure 'A ' were initially employed and when they have been regularised as against the initial employment of each of the petition ers.
This can be done only by reference to appropriate records.
We direct that a senior officer of the Corporation shall be named by respondent No. 1 to look into these alle gations and at the time the question is examined by such officer the petitioners shall be given appropriate opportu nity of being heard, if asked for through counsel also, and all relevant documents should be looked into to ascertain whether the claim of the petitioners that they have been discriminated against in the facts indicated in their writ petition particularly with reference to Annexure 'A ' is correct; and in case it is found that the petitioners have not been given the benefit which has given to the 19 daily rated Conductors specified in Annexure 'A ', petitioners may be conferred the same benefit as has been extended to those 19 persons unless the respondent is able to assign satisfac tory and cogent reasons and states as to why petitioners are not entitled to the same benefit.
This would be so on the footing that regularisation does not require a specified period of service to have been put in.
