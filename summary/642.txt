The assessee was teaching his disciples Vedanta philosophy without any motive or intention of making a profit out of such activity.
One of his disciples made gifts of money to him on several occasions.
It was contended by the assessee that he was not liable to tax on the amounts received as he was not carrying on any vocation and as the receipts were not profits or gains.
Held that, in teaching Vedanta the assessee was carrying on a vocation.
It is not necessary for an activity to be a vocation 134 that it should be an organised activity or that it should be practiced with a motive for making profit.
Commissioner of Inland Revenue vs Incorporated Council of Law Reporting, , 113, followed.
Held, further, that the payments made by the disciple, were income received by the assessee from his vocation.
In the case of a voluntary payment, no tax can be levied on it if it had been made for reasons purely personal to the donee and unconnected with his office or vocation but it will be taxable if it was made because of the office or the vocation of the donee.
The question is not what the donor thought he was doing but why the donee received it.
In the present case it is plain that it was because of the teaching that the gift had been made.
