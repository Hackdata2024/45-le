The Mysore Lotteries and Prize Competitions Control and Tax Act, 1951, was passed by the Mysore Legislature arid came into force on February 1, 1952.
Some of the States comprising the Union of India passed resolutions under article 252(1) of the Constitution of India authorising Parliament to legislate for the control and regulation of Prize Competitions, and in pursuance thereof Parliament passed the , which came into force on April 1, 1956, On February 23, 1956, the Mysore Legislature adopted the said Act by passing a resolution under article 252(1) that "for the purpose of securing uniformity in legislation . the control and regulation of Prize Competitions and all other matters ancillary thereto should be regulated in the State of Mysore by the Prize Com petitions Act, 1955".
The appellants who were conducting prize competitions in the State of Mysore since 1948 filed a petition under article 32 of the Constitution challenging the constitutional validity of the Act, and obtained a stay of the operation of the Act pending disposal of the petition.
The judgment of the Supreme Court dismissing the petition was given on April 9, 1957, and on August 31, 1957, an Ordinance was issued, which later was enacted into an Act, Mysore Act 26 of 1957, by which the Mysore Act of 1951 was amended under which, inter alia, all prize competitions conducted between March 31, 1956, and August 31, 1957, were brought within the purview of the amended Act.
As a result of this, the prize competitions which, as a result of the stay of the operation of the Central Act of 1955, were conducted by the appellants for the said period became liable for taxation.
The appellants challenged the constitutional validity of the amendment on the grounds that (1) the Mysore Legislature by adopting the Central Act was no longer competent to pass any law in regard to prize competitions because the whole matter 231 including the power of taxation was surrendered in favour of Parliament; (2) even if the whole power had not been surren dered the impugned Act i.e., the Mysore Act as amended violated article 252(2) inasmuch as it indirectly amended the Central Act by adding a new method of control by imposition of penalties of a monetary nature; (3) the Mysore Legislature could not amend an Act which stood repealed as a result of the enactment of the Central Act; (4) the Mysore Act as amended was repugnant to the Central Act and was, therefore, to the extent of repugnancy, void under article 254(1) of the Constitution; and (5) it was colourable legislation inasmuch as the tax was imposed on the prize competitions with the object of controlling them.
Held: (1) that by the adoption of the words "control and regulation of prize competitions and all other matters ancillary thereto" in the resolution dated February 23, 1956, the Mysore Legislature did not surrender every matter and power connected with prize competitions including the power to tax: B.R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala vs The Union of India, (1957) S.C.R. 930, relied on.
(2) that the subject of "betting and gambling" in entry 34 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and that of II taxes on betting and gambling" in entry 62 of List II have to be read separately as separate powers, and, therefore, when control and regulation of prize competitions was surrendered to Parliament by the resolution dated February 23, 1956, the power to tax could not be said to have been surrendered; In re The Central Province8 & Berar Art No. XIV of and State of Bombay vs B.M.D. Chamarbaug wala; , , relied on.
(3) that the tax imposed under the Mysore Lotteries and Prize Competitions Control and Tax Act, 1951, was not by way of penalty but was in the exercise of the power which the State Legislature possessed of imposing tax under entry 62, and, consequently, the amendment of the Mysore Act of 1951 could not be said to be a new method of controlling prize competitions nor was it a piece of colourable legislation.

(4) that the , dealt with "betting and gambling" in entry 34, whereas the taxing sections of the Mysore Act related to "tax on betting and gambling" under entry 62 and, therefore, article 252(2) was not contravened by the amendment of the Mysore Act, 232 State of Bombay vs R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala, (1957) S.C.R. 874,relied on.
(5) that there was no amendment of the Mysore Act which stood repealed nor was the retroactive operation of the remending Act affected by article 254(1) of the Constitution.
