Disputes which arose between the parties with respect to carrying out a contract were referred to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce in accordance with an agreement to refer disputes as and when they arose to the arbitration of the Chamber.
The award of the Tribunal of Arbitration was set aside by the High Court.
On an application for referring the matter for arbitration de novo another tribunal was constituted which made a fresh award.
The questions which arose for decision were whether after the first award was set aside the reference to arbitration was exhausted and the arbitrator had become functus offcio and whether without a fresh arbitration agreement it was not possible to have the same dispute decided again by the arbitrator.
^ HELD, that the arbitrator became functus officio after he gave the award but that did not mean that in no circumstances could there be further arbitration proceedings where an award was set aside or that the same arbitrator could never have anything to do with the award with respect to the same dispute.
Section 19 of the Arbitration Act empowered the Court not to supersede the reference and to leave the arbitration agreement effective even when it set aside the award and thereupon it would depend upon the terms of the arbitration agreement whether the arbitration proceedings could go on with respect to the same dispute or with respect to some other dispute arising under the arbitration agreement.
