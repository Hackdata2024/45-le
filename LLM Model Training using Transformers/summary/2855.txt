On the question whether tooth powder manufactured by the assessees was "cosmetic" or a "toilet requisite" liable to tax under section 3(A) of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, read with Entry 6 of Notification No. 905/X dated March 31, 1956/or whether it is an unspecified commodity liable to tax under section 3 of the Act, HELD : Tooth powder is a toilet and therefore taxable under section 3(A) of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, read with the Notification.
Neither the expression 'cosmetic, nor 'toilet requisite ' has been defined under the Act.
The names of articles, the sales and purchases of which are liable to be taxed given in a statute, unless defined in the statute, must be construed not in a technical sense but as understood in a common parlance.
In common parlance a tooth powder is considered as a toilet and that meaning accords with the dictionary meaning as well.
