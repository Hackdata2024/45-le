The Railway Board under the Ministry of Railways of the Gov ernment of India introduced a scheme with effect from the 1st 1346 November 1947 granting compensatory (city) allowance and house rent allowances at certain rates to certain Railway employees (including the 1st respondent who was a railway employee since 1945) stationed at specified head quarters.
The first respondent drew this ' allowance along with his salary up to the 18th August 1948, when he was offered by the Government, quarters 'suitable to his post, but he refused to occupy the same and the house rent allowance was stopped from the date of his refusal to occupy the quarter offered to him.
Rule 3(i) of the Statutory Rules framed by the Government and put into effect on 1st November 1947 runs as follows: "The house rent allowance will not be admissible to those who occupy accommodation provided by Government or those to whom accommodation has been offered by Government but who have refused".
Held, that the house rent allowance is admissible only so long as an employee is stationed at one of the specified places and has not been offered Government quarters.
The rules distinctly provide that the allowance will not be admissible to those who occupy Government quarters or those to whom such quarters have been offered but who have refused to take advantage of the offer.
Once an employee of the description given above has been offered suitable house accommodation and he has refused it, he ceases to be entitled to the house rent allowance and that allowance ceases to be "wages" within the meaning of the definition in section 2(vi) of the Act because it is no more payable under the terms of the contract.
The grant of house rent allowance does not create an indefeasible right in the employee at all places wherever he may be posted and in all circumstances, irrespective of whether or not he has been offered Government quarters.
