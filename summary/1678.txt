The disputes between the appellant company and its workmen were referred to the Industrial Tribunal.
The workmen claimed that (1) they should be given cash allowance in lieu of the tiffin :arrangements made by the company, and (2) the practice started ,by the company of re employing retired persons should be discontinued.
The Tribunal directed : (1) the clerical staff should be paid As.
/8/ per day and the subordinate staff As.
/6/ per day on all working days, and (2) the company should stop the reemployment of retired workmen in the category of clerks above C grade.
In respect of the subordinate staff as also in regard to the lower grade clerks, the Tribunal thought it unnecessary to make any such direction.
The evidence showed that in the region 31 comparable concerns were supplying free tiffin to their employees and that the appellant company had been throughout making .provision for tiffin to its employees.
It was also found that the policy adopted by the company of re employing the retired personnel was not based solely on humanitarian grounds and that when retired persons were re employed they were paid a much smaller salary for doing the same work than they were drawing before retirement.
569 Held:(i) Though under the provisions of the Factories Act there was no obligation on the company, either statutory or otherwise, for giving the workers a cash allowance for tiffin, the history of the relations between the parties coupled with the prevailing practice in the comparable concerns showed that it was an implied condition of service that in addition to the wages and dearness allowance a provision for tiffin was an amenity to which the employees were entitled, and that the decision of the Tribunal could not be interfered with.
(ii) The limited direction issued by the Tribunal in respect of the re employment of retired persons was neither improper nor unjustified.
