Gurdev Singh had certain complaints about the Consolida tion Scheme.
He was not present when his application was being considered.
Therefore, the application was dis missed by the Additional Director, Consolidation.
Thereaf ter, Gurdev Singh respondent No. 3 filed an application for restoration supported by an affidavit attributing his ab sence to his illness.
The Additional Director accepted the ground of respondent No. 3 about illness and granted necessary relief to him.
The appellant filed a writ.peti tion in the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.
The High Court held that the assertion of rights by the appellant merely because of some report con tained in the "Fard Badar" could not take away the effect of the entries in the revenue records The High Court also held that no injustice was caused to the appellant and, there fore, there was no ground for interference under Article 226.
In an appeal by Special Leave, the appellant contended that the Additional Director had no power to review his previous order.
The power to review conferred by section 42 of the Act has to be exercised only after hearing the interested parties.
Since respondent No. 3 was not given an opportunity of being heard on account of his illness, it shows that the order passed was non est and can be ignored at any stage.
The court dismissed the appeal on the ground that this was not a fit case for interference under Article 136.
the Court, however, observed that if the appellant has any right on account of long possession or otherwise he can assert them by adopting proper proceedings and that his rights would not be affected by whatever is stated m the Judgment of this Court as well as the High Court.
