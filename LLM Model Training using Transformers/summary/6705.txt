For the assessment year 1962 63 the Assessee family returned Rs.11,000 as the rent received from the lessee Company.
Regarding the balance of Rs.10,000,it was contended on behalf of the assessee that this amount being directly payable by the lessee company under the lease deed dated 5.5.62 to the Trust College, this ceased to be the income of the assessee.
This contention was negatived by the Department right upto the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.
The other point of dispute concerned the income accruing from certain properties claimed to have been transferred by the family to a charitable Trust created under a Trust Deed dated 14.11.1947.
The I.T.O. assessed the income from these properties in the hands of the family taking the view that the Trust deed only purported to transfer income from the properties and not the corpus and therefore, this income was not eligible for exemption under section 4 (3) (i) of the Indian Income Tax Act 1922.
Assessee 's appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner failed but further appeal to the Tribunal succeeded.
238 Thus the assessee aggrieved on the first contention and the department on the second contention sought references to the High Court.
In respect of assessment year 1962 63 two questions were referred to the High Court on the above two points.
A question in respect of the first point was also referred for the assessment years 1968 69 and 1969 70 and two questions on the two points mentioned above were referred to the High Court in respect of assessment Year 1972 73.
As the High Court answered these questions against the assessee, it preferred four appeals covering the four assessment year in question.
Allowing the appeals in respect of assessment years 1968 69 and 1969 70 and party allowing the other two appeals in respect of assessment years 1962 63 and 1973 74, this Court, HELD:(1) The assessee is the owner of the properties in question leased out to the company on an annual rent of Rs.21,000.
This is income of the family.
The Assessee 's agreement with the company that Rs.10,000 out of the rent due to it should be paid directly to the College is only a mode of application of the income by the family which makes no difference in its liability to tax on the entire rent of Rs.21,000 nor does the fact that the college has been given a right to sue for and recover this sum directly from the company in case of default, alter this position.
The payment to, or recovery of, Rs.10,000 by the college will only discharge, in part, the liability of the company to pay a rent of Rs.21,000 to the assessee under the lease deed.
The creation of a charge in favour of the college does not make any difference.
It only obliges the company to pay a part of the rent to the college on behalf of the assessee but the existence of a mere obligation is not sufficient to constitute diversion of income.
Where the obligation flows out of an antecedent and independent title in the former, it effectively slices away a part of the corpus of the right of the latter to receive the entire income and so it would be a case of diversion.
On the other hand, where the obligation is self imposed or gratuitous it is only a case of an application of income.
We, therefore, agree with the High Court that the assessee is liable to tax on the entire rental income of Rs.21,000.
[245F 246A, E;247C D,248B] (2) A registered conveyance of immovable property to the trustees is necessary where the trustees are persons other than the author.
But this requirement does not arise where the author is himself to be the trustee.
While a trust is not complete until the trust property is vested in trustees for the benefit of the cestui que trust, this can be 239 done by the settlor, where he is himself the trustee, by a declaration of trust, using language which, taken in connection with his acts, shows a clear intention on his part to divest himself of all beneficial interest in it and to exercise dominion and control over it exclusively as a trustee.
Section 6 of the Indian Trusts Act, makes this clear beyond all doubt.
The assessee 's full ownership of an unqualified right to enjoy the properties gets restricted by the trust deed, which creates an overriding title in the beneficiaries regarding the use of the income from such properties in the manner set out therein and no other.
In fact after the execution of such a trust deed, the properties are no longer held by the assessee as the absolute owner thereof but as a trustee with a legal obligation to apply the income exclusively for charitable purposes, thus attracting the provisions for exemption contained in the Act.
We are inclined to take the view that the Trust deed of 1947 should be construed as a valid trust which has the effect of diverting the income at the source and that the income thereafter ceased to be the income of the assessee family.[248G 249B, C D; E F] C.I.T. vs Sitaldas Tirathdas, [1961] 41 I.T.R.367, S.C.Murlidhar Himmatsingka vs I.T.O., [1961] 62 I.T.R.323, S.C.Mahaliram Santhalia vs C.I.T., [1958] 33 I.T.R.261, referred to.
