In each of the two appeals before the court, suits had been filed by landlords under the Delhi and Ajmer Rent Control Act, 1952, for ejectment on the ground that the tenants had erected certain structures without the authority of the landlords and in violation of the conditions of ease between the landlord and the concerned authorities.
However, in both these cases the tenants had removed the offending structures during be pendency of the suits and the question for decision in both the cases was whether the tenant could still be ejected after he had removed the authorised structures and there was no further danger to the landlords ' leases being forfeited.
It was contended on behalf of the landlords that once a breach had been committed by a tenant within the meaning of cl.
(k) of the proviso to section 13(1) of the 1952 Act, he was liable to be ejected even though the landlord may never have given him notice about the breach and may not even have required him to remove it; and that his liability to ejectment would continue even if be had removed the offending structure before the filing of the suit or while it was pending.
Furthermore, by virtue of the provisions of section 57(2) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, (which repealed the 1952 Act), these two appeals fell to be governed by cl.
(k) of the proviso to section 13(1) of the 1952 Act and not by cl.
(k) of proviso to section 14(1) of 1958 Act or by section 14(11) of that Act which made it possible for the Controller not to make an order of eviction if the tenant complied with any requirements specified by the Controller; this was so because the first proviso to section 57(2) of the 1958 Act which required that, in certain circumstances regard shall be had to the 1958 Act, was not applicable to these two cases.
HELD : (i) While considering the scope of the first proviso to section 57(2), it was held in Karam Singh vs Sri Pratap Chand, A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 1305 that where, in the 1958 Act, there was a radical departure from the 1952 Act, the latter Act would continue to apply to pending proceedings; but where the 1958 Act had slightly modified or clarified the previous provisions, then these modifications or clarifications would apply Section 14(11) of the 1958 Act did not provide a radical departure from the provisions of the 1952 Act because when the latter Act was in force, it would have been possible for the court in a suit based on cl.
(k ) of the proviso to section 13(1) to give relief against forfeiture in a proper case on the analogy of section 114A of the Transfer of Property Act where the tenant has removed the offending structure before the suit was filed; or even where he had done so during the pendency of the suit if reasonable time was not allowed in the notice contemplated by cl.
(k) of the provisio to section 13(1).
when section 14(11) of the 1958 Act gave power to the Controller to give relief to the tenant under the conditions mentioned therein, it ,was in fact clarifying and slightly modifying what the court could 706 already do under the 1952 Act.
Therefore, regard could be had to the provisions of section 14(11) of the 1958 Act and relief granted to the tenants in both appeals.
[710 E F; 711 F H; 712 C E] (ii) Under the 1952 Act, the language of the proviso to section 13(1) was imperative and laid down that nothing in the Act applied when various clauses of the proviso were satisfied.
Although the language of the proviso to section 14(1) of the 1958 Act is not so imperative, there is no difference in substance.
Where the requirements of the proviso under the 1958 Act are satisfied, the Controller has to pass a decree for ejectment unless there is provision otherwise in section 14.
