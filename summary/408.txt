Common intention required by section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and common object set out under section 149, though they sometimes overlap, are used in different senses and should be kept distinct.
In a case under section 149 there need not be a prior concert and meeting of minds, it is enough that each has the same object in view and their number is five or more and they act as an assembly to achieve that object.
When a crowd assembles and there is an uproar and people are killed and injured, it is only natural for others to rush to the scene with whatever arms they can snatch.
Some may have an unlawful motive but others may not, and in such circumstances it is impossible to say that they were all motivated by a common intention with prior concert.
What a court of fact should do in such a case is to find from the evidence which of them individually had an unlawful object in view, or having originally a lawful object in view deve loped it later on into an unlawful one and if it finds that there were five or more such persons who acted together there would be an unlawful assembly.
Consequently, in a case where there were circumstances from which the courts of fact could deduce that an unlawful object developed with more than five to share it after the fighting started and they were satisfied that it did, there was no reason why their concurrent decisions should be set aside.
This court will be slow to entertain a question of prejudice when details are not furnished; also, the fact that the objection was not taken at an early stage will be taken into account.
