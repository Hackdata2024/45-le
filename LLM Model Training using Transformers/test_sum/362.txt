The assesses carrying on business in the City of Bombay was assessed to income tax for the years 1943 44 to 1947 48 and 1951 52 by the Income tax Officer C 1 Ward Bombay.
As the assessee did not pay the income tax due the Income tax Officer issued in April 1951 to the Additional Collector of Bombay a recovery certificate under section 46(2) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922.
In February 1954 the Additional Collector issued a notice of demand and as no payment was made he attached the good will and tenancy rights of the assessee 's premises by a warrant of attachment dated 24th March 1954, 888 A sale was held in February 1955.
The sale proceeds not being sufficient to satisfy the assessed tax the Additional Collector issued a notice under section 13 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act, 1876 requiring the assessee to appear before him and show cause why he should not be apprehended and confined to civil prison in satisfaction of the said certified demand.
In default of assessee 's appearance and showing cause a warrant for his arrest was issued under section 13 of the Bombay Act, II of 1876 and he was actually arrested on 1st July 1955.
An application to the Bombay High Court under article 226 of the Constitution for a writ in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus having proved unsuccessful, an application under article 32 was filed in the Supreme Court for the same relief.
Two main points urged on behalf of the assessee were: (a) that section 46(2) of the Indian Income tax Act under which the Income tax Officer issued the recovery certificate to the Additional Collector of Bombay was void, under article 13 (1) of the Constitution in that it offended article 21 and article 14 of the Constitution; (b)that section 13 of the Bombay Land Revenue Act, 1876 (Bombay Act II of 1876) under which the warrant of arrest was issued by the Additional Collector was void under article 13(1) of the Constitution as the same was repugnant to article 14 of the Constitution.
Held (as regards a) (1) that there was no violation of fundamental rights under article 21 of the Constitution inasmuch as section 13 of the Bombay Act II of 1876 under which warrant of arrest was issued for the recovery of the demand certified under section 46(2) of the Indian Income tax Act constituted a procedure established by law.
Both section 13 of Bombay Act II of 1876 and section 46 of the Indian Income tax Act under which action had been taken against the assessee were not void and therefore no question of violation of funda mental rights under article 21 could arise at all) (ii)the contention that section 46(2) of the Indian Income tax Act provides for two different and alternative methods of recovery of the dues and clothes the Collector with the unfettered and unguided power to apply either of the two methods inasmuch as it enables the Collector at his will to discriminate between two defaulters who are similarly situated and thus violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution was without force because sub section (2) of section 46 does not prescribe two different procedures.
The proviso enacted therein does not indicate a different and alternative mode of recovery of the certified amount of tax but only confers additional powers on the Collector for the better and more effective application of the only mode of recovery authorised by the body of sub section (2) of section 46 and therefore there was no question of possibility of dis crimination at all; (iii)the further contention that section 46(2) of the Indian Incometax Act violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution and has thus become void under article 14 of the Constitution as section 46(2) required the Collector,on receipt of the requisite certificate from 889 the Income tax Officer, to recover the amount specified in the certificate as if it were an arrear of the land revenue and there are different laws adopted by different States for the recovery of land revenues and thus there is discrimination on the ground that defaulters are treated differently in different States is also without force be cause discrimination complained of is a permissible classification and does not offend the fundamental right guaranteed by article 14 as the grouping of the income tax defaulters in separate categories on classes State wise is a territorial classification which is based on an intelligible differentia and there is a reasonable nexus or co relation between the basis of classification and the object sought to be achieved by the Income tax Act.
The fact that the income tax demand is a Union public demand makes no difference in the legal position.
Held, (as regards b) that the contention that section 13 of the Bombay Act II of 1876 became unconstitutional under article 13(1) of the Constitution in that the procedure prescribed by section 13 of the Bombay Act II of 1876 in respect of a defaulter residing in the City of Bombay was harsher and more drastic than the procedure laid down in section 157 of the Bombay Act V of 1879 in respect of a defaulter residing outside the City of Bombay was without force because section 13 of the Bombay Act II of 1876 was amended on 8th October 1954 and a new law laid down a law similar to the law laid down by section 157 of the Bombay Act V of 1879 and thus the vice of unconstitutionality 'if any ' was removed.
