A suit instituted by the respondents for the recovery of money due under a simple mortgage from the appellants was compromised by the parties under a memo dated September 30, 1955, and the court passed a decree as per the terms of the compromise By cl. 1 of the memo the defendants agreed to a 47 decree being passed as prayed for in the suit, while cl. 2 recited: "That the mortgaged properties are hereby sold for the amount of the decree in full satisfaction thereof The defendants will execute a regular sale and within ten days from this date.
" The appellants did not comply with the terms of cl. 2 and on October 31, 1955, the respondents made an application before the court praying that the appellants might be directed to excecute a sale deed as per the terms of the compromise.
The appellants pleaded that the relief sought by the respondents could not be had in execution proceedings but only by a separate suit, on the grounds, inter alia, that the same did not relate to the suit within O. 23, r. 3, of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that, in any case, on a proper construction of the compromise the consideration therefore was not the actual execution of the conveyance by the judgment debtor but merely the agreement to execute such a conveyance.
Held : (1) that the terms of the compromise related to the suit inasmuch as the property which was to be conveyed consisted entirely of the property included in the mortgage.
(2) that on the true construction of the compromise, though cls. 2 to 6 might constitute an integrated scheme for adjusting the rights of parties, a mere agreement to convey contained in cl. 2 by itself did not amount to a satisfaction of the decree and that the consideration for the compromise was the execution of a conveyance.
