Under section 6 of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947, the Government issued a notification exempting certain goods from the 499 payment of sales tax, including "green vegetables other than potatoes, except when sold in sealed containers".
The appellant who was a producer of sugar can was assessed to sales tax.
He contended that sugar cane was a green vegetables and was exempted from tax and that he was not a dealer as defined in section 2 (c) of the Act and could not be assessed to sales tax. ^ Held, that sugar cane was not a green vegetable and was not exempted under the notification.
The word "vegetables" in taxing statutes was to be understood as in common parlance i.e. denoting class of vegetables which were grown in a kitchen garden or in a farm and were used for the table.
The dictionaries defined sugar cane as a "grass." Ramavtar Budhaiprasad vs Assistant Sales Tax Officer, Akola, ; , followed.
The State of Bombay vs R. section Phadtare, [1956] 7 section T. C. 495, disapproved.

Section 2(c) was amended by the Bihar Annual Finance Act, 1950.
The amended was not a temporary amendment for only one year; the amended section was applicable to the present case.
The amending Act did not require the assent of the President as the matter fell entirely within entry 54 of the State List.
