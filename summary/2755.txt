The appellant was convicted for selling food with impermissible colouring matter.
He contended that as his request for summoning the Public Analyst for cross examination had not been acceded to he had been prejudiced and as such the entire proceeding against him were vitiated The High Court rejected the contention on the ground that section 510 of the Code of Criminal Procedure bad no application in that it only dealt with the experts mentioned therein.
The Court also observed that when the accused desired to challenge the report of the Public Analyst under the Act, he had to follow the procedure provided in section 13(2) for sending the sample to the Director of Central Food Laboratory whose report would be final and conclusive.
Dismissing the appeal, HELD: Where certificates are not made final and conclusive evidence of the facts stated therein, 'It will be open to the party against whom certificates are given either to rebut the facts stated therein by his own or other evidence or to require the expert to be produced for cross examination which prayer the court is bound to consider on merits in granting or rejecting it.
The court may reject the prayer for good and sufficient reasons such as for instance where it is made for the purpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice.
[685 B C; F G] The present case is not a fit case for interference.
No attempt was made to establish why the evidence was required and as to the specific point which needed to be elucidated.
The accused knew what colouring matter he added; he could have easily said that that colour was one of the permitted colours; but he did not say so in his examination under section 34 nor did he produce any evidence of those whom he employed as to the colouring matter which was added.
The application was made more to delay the disposal of the case.
