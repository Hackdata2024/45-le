The respondents obtained a lease for cultivation of land.
On the landlord 's desire to cultivate the land personally, the respondents surrendered the lands to the landlord.
The surrender was not in writing nor was there verification of the surrender by the Tehsildar.
The landlord cultivated the land for a few years, and thereafter granted a lease to the appellant.
The respondents applied under section 36 of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands (Vidarbha Region) Act, 1958, for restoration of possession to them.
On the question whether the eviction of respondent was legal, this Court, HELD : Possession obtained by the landlord was not lawful for, he obtained possession of the lands from the tenants without complying with the requirements of section 20 and sub section
(2) of section 36.
Sub section (2) of section 36 prohibits the landlord from obtaining possession of any land held by a tenant except under an order of Tahsildar.
Delivery of possession voluntarily by the respondents did not render possession of the landlord valid.
Under s.36(1) a tenant who has been evicted in contravention of sub section
(2) may apply in writing to the Tahsildar for such possession.
[1659 E] By section 20 of the Act which deals with surrender it is expressly provided that surrender shall be in writing and shall be verified in the prescribed manner.
Surrender of tenancy which does not comply with the requirements of section 20 is ineffective.
Again the terms of sub section
(2) of section 36 are explicit; they are not subject to any implication that possession obtained with the consent of the tenant, but without an order of the Tahsildar is valid.
[659 H] In the present case there is no surrender of tenancy in writing and no verification of surrender by the Tahsildar.
