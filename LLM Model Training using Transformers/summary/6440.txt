In a claim for compensation, the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal held that the insurer was not liable to meet the award of compensation against the owner of the vehicle, as the policy had been taken after the accident.
On appeal, the High Court held that the insurance policy obtained on the date of accident became operative from the commencement of the date of insurance, i.e. from the previous mid night, and since the accident took place on the date of the policy, the insurer became liable.
Dismissing the appeals by the insurer, this Court.
HELD: When a policy is taken on a particular date, its effectiveness is from the commencement of the date.
In the instant case, the insurance was taken from 28th September, 1984, which is the date of the accident.
The High Court was, therefore, right in holding that the insurer was liable in terms of the Act to meet the liability of the owner under the award.
