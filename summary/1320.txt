Mr. A, an Advocate on Record of this Court, wrote letters soliciting clients.
One of such letters, a post card was addressed to the Law Minister of Maharashtra and ended as follows, "You might have got an Advocate on Record in this Court but I would like to place my services at your disposal is you so wish and agree".
To the Registrar of this Court he admitted having written the post card, but before the Tribunal stoutly denied having done so.
The Tribunal found on evidence that the Advocate had written the post card.
When the matter came up before the court, the Advocate at first denied having written the post card but on being pressed by the court to make a true statement admitted that he had written the postcard and had admitted that before the Registrar.
^ Held, that it is against the etiquette of the Bar and its professional ethics to solicit briefs from clients and an Advocate who does so must be guilty of grossly unprofessional conduct.
There can be no doubt in the instant case that the Advocate concerned had written the post card soliciting briefs.
It makes no difference whether he did so in ignorance of this elementary rule of the profession or in disregard of it, since his conduct in court showed that he had no regard for truth and, consequently, he deserved no sympathy of the court and must be suspended.
