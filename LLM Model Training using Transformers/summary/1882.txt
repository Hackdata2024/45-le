The appellant was convicted in four cases for an offence under section 409 I.P.C. He was sentenced to imprisonment and line in the first two cases.
The sentences imposed in the other two cases for the offence under section 409 I.P.C. were to run consecutively.
The High Court dismissed the appellant 's appeal.
HELD : (i) There had been no illegality in the Court 's trying the appellant in four cases regarding amounts embezzled within a few months and in not ordering the various sentences awarded in different Sessions Trials to run concurrently.
[288 C] The normal rule is that there should be a charge for each distinct offence, as provided in section 233 of the Code.
Section 222 mentions what the contents of the charge should be.
It is only in certain circumstances that the court is authorised to Jump up the various items with respect to which criminal breach of trust was committed and to mention the total amount misappropriated within a year in the charge.
When so done, the charge is deemed to be the charge of one offence.
[286 H 287 B] (ii)Section 234 is an enabling provision and is an exception to a. 233 of Code of Criminal Procedure.
There is nothing illegal in trying each of the several offences separately.
[287 E] (iii)Assuming without deciding, that these offences could be said to have been committed in the course of the same transactions, the separate trial for certain specific offences is not illegal.
Section 235 too is an enabling section.
