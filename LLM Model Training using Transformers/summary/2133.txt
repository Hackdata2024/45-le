The tenant of a flat was in arrears of rent for more than six months.
The landlord served a notice on the tenant demanding the rent.
The tenant did not pay it within one month of the notice, but tendered it after the expiry of the month.
The landlord refused to receive it and filed a suit for eviction under section 12(3) (a) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947.
The tenant claimed the protection of section 12(1) of the Act on the ground that she was ready and willing to pay the rent before the institution of the suit.
HELD : Under section 12(3) (a), the landlord is vested with the right to recover possession of the premises if the rent is in arrears for six months or more, the tenant neglects to pay it until after the expiry of one month after notice demanding the rent and other conditions of sub s.(3) (a) are saitisfied.
This right cannot be defeated by showing that the tenant was ready and willing to pay the rent after the default but before the institution of the suit.
In a case falling within sub section
(3) (a), the tenant must be dealt with under its special provisions and he cannot claim any protection from eviction under the general provisions of sub section
(1): and the court was bound to pass a decree for eviction.
