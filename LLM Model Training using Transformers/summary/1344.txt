In 1956 a notice was issued to the respondent under section 34(1)(a) of the Indian Income tax Act, calling upon him to make a return on the ground that his income had escaped assessment for the year ending 31st March, 1949 The respondent contended that notice under section 34 of the Act could not be issued to him because of the lapse of eight years from the end of the accounting year.
This contention was not accepted by the Income Tax officer.
The assessee then filed an application under article 226 of the Constitution.
The High Court held on a construction of section 34 of the Act, that the words 'any year ' as used in section 34(1)(a) mean.
not the assessment year but the accounting year.
The Income tax officer appealed The contention was that the words 'any year ' in cl.
(a) refer to the assessment year.
^ Held, that the correct way of interpreting section 34(1)(a) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, read with the provisions of the Indian Finance Act, 1948, is that the words 'for any year ' mean for any assessment year and not for any accounting year because the assessment is for the assessment year although of the income which accrued in the previous year (year of account) The Previous year for different heads of income falling under different sections of the Indian Income tax Act may vary but does not give different starting points of limitation for different sources of income.
