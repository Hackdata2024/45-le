The appellants failed to file their return within the prescribed time and on a notice issued under section 28(1)(a) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, to show cause why penalty should not be imposed on them, they filed a written reply.
Without affording them an opportunity of being heard as required by section 28(3) of the Act the Income tax Officer imposed a penalty on them.
On appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner set aside the order and directed refund of the penalty.
Thereafter the Income tax Officer issued a further notice giving an opportunity to the appel lants of being heard.
The appellants objected to this notice and 72 contended that the Income tax Officer could no longer proceed to re assess the penalty in the absence of an express order of remand by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner whose order had become final.
Held, that where an order of imposition of penalty made by the Income tax Officer under section 28(1)(a) of the Indian Incometax Act was vitiated, not by any initial illegality but by one which supervened during the course of the proceedings and the said order was vacated on appeal, the Income tax Officer was well within his jurisdiction in continuing the proceedings from the stage at which the illegality had occurred and could re assess the penalty though no express order of remand was made.
