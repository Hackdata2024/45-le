The assessee who was dealing in iron scrap and hardware had purchased a jute press and sold it at a profit.
The Income tax Officer brought to tax in the hands of the assessee, the profit arising out of this sale.
The Appellate Tribunal modified the order and reduced the total income.
At the instance of assessee the Tribunal referred to the High Court, the question, whether the surplus received by the assessee as a result of the sale of the jute press arose out of an adventure in the nature of trade and was, therefore, liable to tax.
The High Court answered the question in affirmative.
In appeal; HELD: The question must be answered in the negative.
Granting that the assessee made a profitable bargain when he purchased the property and granting further that the assessee had, when he purchased it, a desire to sell the property, if a favourable offer was forthcoming, these could not without other circumstances, justify an inference that the assessee intended by purchasing the property to start a venture in the nature of trade.
[609H 610A] A profit motive in entering a transact on is no decisive, for, an accretion to capital does not become taxable income, merely because an asset was acquired in the expectation that it may be sold at a profit.
[608F] Purchase of the property by the assessee was an isolated transaction not related to the business of the assessee.
[608G] Case law referred to.
