The appellant.
was tried by the Sessions judge and acquitted of the charge of murder.
On appeal the High Court convicted him and sentenced him to imprisonment for life.
The appellant applied for and was granted a certificate under Art 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution for appeal to the Supreme Court on the ground that there was unusual delay in delivering the judgment of the High Court and that the judg ment failed to deal with certain questions of fact which were raised at the hearing of the appeal.
Held, that the certificate granted by the High Court was not a proper certificate.
The mere ground of delay in giving judgment did not fall within the words "fit one for appeal to the Supreme Court" in article 134 (1) (c).
The points raised in the appeal before the High Court were questions of fact and the High Court was not justified in passing such questions on to the Supreme Court for further consideration thus converting the Supreme Court into a court of appeal on facts.
