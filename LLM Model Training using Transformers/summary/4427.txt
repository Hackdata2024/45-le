Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: 1.
In the context and background of the notification "biscuit" cannot be treated as "cooked food".
In the Hindi text of the notification, issued contemporaneously with the English version, the words (cooked food) were used as the equivalent for cooked food.
Ordinarily biscuit is not understood as "cooked food".
Nor any one asking for some "cooked food" in a hotel will be served with "biscuits" in Uttar Pradesh.
The item has been correctly treated as "unclassified commodity" and tax levied accordingly.

It is a well settled rule of construction that the words used in a law imposing a tax should be construed in the same way in which they are understood in ordinary parlance in the area in which the law is in force.
If an expression is capable of a wider meaning as well as narrower meaning the question whether the wider or the narrower meaning should be given depends on the context and the background of the case.
