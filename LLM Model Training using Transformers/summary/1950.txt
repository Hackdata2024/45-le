A badli workman worked as the appellant 's employee for more than 240 days, with interruptions in each of the calendar years 1959 and 1960.
He was retrenched in 1961.
An industrial dispute having arisen, it was referred to the Tribunal, which held, that the appellant was not justified in terminating the services of the workman as the provisions of section 25F of the were not com plied with.
In its appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that the section could apply only if the workman had put in 240 days ' continuous service in any of the years 1959 and 1960.
HELD: Section 25B says that, for the purpose of section 25F a workman who, in a period of 12 calendar months has actually worked for not less than 240 days shall be deemed to have completed one year of continuous service.
Service for 240 days in a period of 12 calendar months is equal not only to service for a year but is to be deemed continuous service even if interrupted.
Therefore, though section 25F speaks of continuous service for not less than one year under the employer, both the conditions are fulfilled if the workman has actually worked for 240 days during a period of 12 calendar months.
It is not necessary to read the definition of continuous service in section 2(fee) into section 25B, because, the fiction converts service of 240 days in a period of the twelve calendar months into continuous service for one complete year.
[451C E] The amendments introduced by the Industrial Disputes (Amend ment) Act, 1964 into sections 25B and 25F only removed the discordance between the unmended sections 25B and 25F (b) and vagueness which existed previously.
But neither before the amendments nor after, is uninterrupted service necessary, if the total service is 240 days in a period of 12 calendar months.
