The facts of this case were almost identical with that of Municipal Corporation of Delhi vs Ram Kishan Rohtagi and Ors.
(the case reported immediately before this one).
However Paragraph 5 of the complaint filed in this case was in the following terms: "That accused Ram Kishan Bajal is the Chairman, accused R.P. Neyatiya is the Managing Director and accused Nos.
7 to 12 are the Directors of the Hindustan Sugar Mills Ltd. and were incharge of and responsible to it for the conduct of its business at the time of commission of offence.
" Adopting a line of reasoning similar to the one adopted by it in the earlier case, the High Court had quashed the proceeding against the accused (respondents here).
After pointing out that the law on the subject had been dealt with in the earlier case and allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: In this case a clear averment has been made in Para 5 of the complaint regarding the active role played by the respondents and the extent of their liability and a prima facie case for summoning the accused has been made out.
It cannot therefore be said that Paragraph 5 of the complaint is vague and does not implicate the respondents.
As to what would be the evidence against the respondents is not a matter to be considered at this stage and would have to be proved at the trial.
The High Court went wrong in holding that tho allegations made Paragraph 5 were vague.
