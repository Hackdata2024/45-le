For the supply of milk to the Government Hospital at Cannanore for the year 1948 49, the petitioner and the third respondent, the Co operative Milk Supplies Society, Cannanore, had submitted tenders, and the Superintendent who scrutinised them accepted that of the petitioner and communicated to the Director of Public Health the reasons for the decision.
Subsequently, the contract to the petitioner was cancelled after giving the requisite notice in terms of Cl. 20 Of the tender, and he was informed that it was the policy of the Government that in the matter of supply to Government medical institutions in Cannanore District, the Co operative Milk Supplies Union was to be given contracts on the basis of prices fixed by the Revenue Department.
The petitioner contended, in a petition filed under article 32 Of the Constitution, that there had been discrimination against him vis a vis the third respondent, that he was denied equal opportunity of employment under the State, and that the fundamental rights under articles 14, 16(1), 19(1) (g) and 31 had been infringed.
Held, that none of the fundamental rights were involved in the present case.
A contract which is held from Government stands on no different footing from a contract held from a private party and when one person is chosen rather than another the aggrieved party cannot claim the protection of article 14.
A contract for the supply of goods is not a contract of employment and the petitioner who was supplying milk to the State hospital was in no sense a servant and no question of employment qua servant arose.
Article 16 (1) was therefore not attracted to the case.
