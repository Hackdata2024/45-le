Allowing the petition, the Court ^ HELD: 1.
Where the detaining authority is satisfied that the grounds are couched in a language which is not known to the detenu, it must see to it that the grounds are explained to the detenu, a translated script is given to him and the grounds bear some sort of a certificate to show that the grounds have been explained to the detenu in the language, which he understands.
[14O0 D E] A bare denial at the stage when the Habeas Corpus petition is filed in the court by the detaining authority that those formalities were observed would be of no consequence particularly when it is not supported by any document or by any affidavit of the person who had done the job of explaining or translation.
[14O0 E F] Hadibandhu Das vs District Magistrate, Cuttack and Anr. ; followed.
Courts frown on detention without trial and insist on the strict compliance of the constitutional safeguards enshrined in Article 22(5) to She letter of the law, because a non compliance of these safeguards would itself be sufficient to vitiate the order of detention.
[14O0 F G] 3.
Section ll of COFEPOSA confers a constitutional right on the detenu to have his representation considered by the Central Government.
It is true that the Central Government has a discretion to revoke or confirm the detention but the detenu has undoubtedly a right that his representation should be considered by the Central Government for whatever worth it is.
The mere fact that the detenu had sent a copy to the Central Government does not absolve the detaining authority from the statutory duty of forwarding the representation to the Central Government.
[14O1 B D] [The Court expressed the hope that in future the detaining authorities should fully apply their mind so as to result in a strict compliance of the constitutional safeguards contained in the Constitution, more particularly, be cause the liberty of the subject is in peril.]
