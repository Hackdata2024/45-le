Dismissing the writ petition.
the Court.
HELD: 1.
The period of parole of the detenu from May 15, 1986 to February 28.
1987 has to be excluded in reckoning the period of his detention for one year under sub section
(1) of section 3 of the .
[1136D, G H] 2.1 The purpose and object of section 10 of the Act is to prescribe not only a maximum period for which a person against whom a detention order under the Act is made may be held in actual custody pursuant to the said order but also the method by which the period is to be computed.
The key to the interpretation of the section is in the words "may be detained.
" The subsequent words "from the date of detention" which follow the words "maximum period of one year" merely define the starting point from which the maximum period of detention of one year is to be reckoned in a case not fall ing under section 9.
There is no justifiable reason why the word "detain" should not receive its plain and natural meaning 'to hold in custody '.
[1134B; 1133G, EP] 2.2 The period during which the detenu is on parole cannot be said to be a period during which he has been held in custody pursuant to the order of his detention.
In such a case he was not in actual custody.
The order of detention prescribes the place where the detenu is to be detained.
Parole brings him out of confinement from that place and detention as contemplated by the Act is interrupted until the detenu is put back into custody.
The running of the period recommences then and 1125 a total period of one year has to be counted by putting the different periods of actual detention together.
In the instant case it cannot, therefore, be said that the period during which the detenu was on.
parole has to be taken into consideration in computing the maximum period of detention authorised by section 10 of the Act.

1342 43 of 1982 decided on July 10, 1985, distinguished.
Parole is the release of a prisoner from a penal or correctional institution after he has served a part of his sentence under the continuous custody of the State and under conditions that permit his in carceration in the event of misbehavior.
It is a grant of partial liberty or lessening of restrictions to a convict prisoner and does not change the status of the prisoner.
[1131E, BC] Preventive detention is not punishment.
The scheme of section 12.
unless temporary release by the appropriate Government is taken to be one of parole, keeps away parole from the subject of preventive detention.
[1130F; 1135F] 4.1 What in a given situation should be the sufficient period for a person to be detained for the purpose of the COFEPOSA Act is one for the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority.
Preventive detention jurisprudence in this regard is very different from regular conviction fol lowed by sentence that an accused is to suffer.
[1134EF] 4.2 Whether it be under article 226 or article 32 of the Constitution.
the Court has no jurisdiction either under the Act or under the general principles of law or in exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction to deal with the duration of the period of detention either by abridging or enlarging it.
The only power that is available to it is to quash the order in case it is found to be illegal.
It would not, therefore, be open to the Court to reduce the period of detention by admitting the detenu on parole.
[1134F,E] 5.
Sub section
(6) of section 12 of the Act puts a statutory bar to the release of the detenu after an order of detention has been made and the detenu lodged in custody.
It is the appro priate Government and not the Court 1126 which deal with a case of temporary release of the detenu under subss.(1) and (1A) of section 12 of the Act.
The detenu seeking to have the benefit of temporary relief must go to the appropriate Government first.
The Court cannot entertain his application for parole straightaway.
On the principle that exercise of administrative jurisdiction is open to Judicial review by the superior Court, the High Court under article 226 or this Court under article 32 may in a given case examine the legality and propriety of the Government action.

Babulal Das vs State of West Bengal, ; ; Anil Dey vs State of West Bengal, and Golam Hussain vs Commissioner of Police, Calcutta & Ors. ; , overruled.
It is desirable to insert in the COFEPOSA Act or the Rules made thereunder a provision like sub s.(4) of section 389 of the Code of.
Criminal Procedure, 1973 that when an action is taken under section 12 of the Act and the appropriate Govern ment makes a temporary release order the order of such temporary release whether on bail or parole has to be ex cluded in computing the period of detention.
