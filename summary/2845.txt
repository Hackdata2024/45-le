In a suit for evicition on the ground of non payment of rent a decree was passed directing the tenant to pay the landlady 's costs, as, by that time, the tenant had paid all the arrears of rent as fixed; but the tenant did not pay or tender the costs.
Therefore, the court passed an order of eviction.
His appeal, a revision to the High Court, and a review petition to the High Court were all dismissed.
In appeal to this Court, HELD : (1) The tenant would be entitled to the protection under section 12(3) (b) of the, Bombay Rent Act, only if he complied with its provisions by paying or tendering not only the arrears of rent but also the costs of the suit.
Since the appellant admitted his inability to, comply with the provision, he could not claim protection against eviction.
[627 D, G] (2) Assuming that the costs were paid at a later date as alleged by the appellant, that fact was not brought to the notice of the High Court, and therefore this Court will not interfere with the exercise of discretion by the High Court in the set of facts and circumstances presented to the High Court.
