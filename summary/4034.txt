HELD: The High Court in exercising its jurisdiction under article 226 of the Constitution must have regard to the well established principles and unless it is satisfied that the normal statutory remedy is likely to be too dilatory to give relief, it should be loath to act under article 226.
It should be extremely circumspect in granting relief during the pendency of criminal investigations.
[134 G H] The investigation of a criminal offence is a very sensitive phase where the investigating authority has to collect evidence from all odd corners and anything that is likely to thwart its course may inhibit the interests of justice.
[135A] Courts must be very careful to see that every condition or need that the investigator points out as essential for discharging his investigative functions, should be readily conceded unless plainly unreasonable.
At the stage of investigation it is risky for the court to intervene except where manifest injustice cries for its Order.
[135C D]
