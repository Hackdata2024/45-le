The respondent obtained a joint decree against the appellant and his partner M. Against the decree, the appellant alone appealed to the High Court.
M was impleaded as the 'second respondent in the appeal.
The notice of appeal sent to M was returned unserved.
The High Court dismissed the appeal on the view that since there was a joint decree against the appellant and M in a suit founded on a joint cause of action and the decree against M had become final, the appellant could not claim to be heard on his appeal; if he was heard there could be two conflicting decisions between the same parties and in the same suit based on the same cause of action.
The High Court also held that the appellant had not taken steps to serve M and the appeal must be dismissed for want of prosecution.
On appeal to this Court HELD : The judgment of the High Court could not be sustained.
The appeal could not be dismissed on the ground that M was not served with the notice of appeal, nor, in view of the provisions of Order 41 Rule 4, could the High Court dismiss the appeal on the ground that there was a possibility of two conflicting decrees.
[297 G H] The object of the rule is to enable one of the parties to a suit to obtain relief in appeal when the decree appealed from proceeds on a ground common to him and others.
The Court in such an appeal may reverse or vary the decree in favour of all the parties who are in the same interest as the appellant.
