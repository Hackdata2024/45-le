A Sudra Hindu died leaving two widows and an illegitimate son by a continuously and exclusively kept concubine.
The son succeeded to a moiety of the estate and the widows succeeded to the other moiety.
The widows died without leaving any daughter or daughter 's son.
The reversioners filed a suit for recovery of possession of the estate.
The illegitimate son contended that on the death of his father he was entitled to succeed to half the estate the other going to the widows and that on the death of the widows he was entitled to the half share held by them.
Held, that the illegitimate son succeeded to half the estate upon the death of the father and succeeded to the other half on the death of the widows.
An illegitimate son has the status of a son under the Hindu Law; but he has no rights by birth and cannot claim partition during his father 's lifetime.
On the father 's death he takes his father 's self acquired property along with the legitimate son and in case the legitimate son dies, he takes the entire property by survivorship.
If there is no legitimate son, he would be entitled only to a half share when there is a widow, daughter ox daughter 's son of the last male holder.
In the absence of any one of these three heirs, he succeeds to the entire state.
If the widow succeeds to half the estate, upon her death succession again opens to half the estate of the last male 348 holder held by her and the illegitimate son, who has the status of a son, has a preferential claim over all other reversioners.
