The appellant was a prosecution witness against the respondents.
That case ended in the acquittal of the respondents.
An application was moved under section 476 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the Magistrate against the appellant and some other prosecution witnesses with a prayer that a complaint be made against them.
The Magistrate was of opinion that section 479A of the Code of Criminal Procedure was a complete bar to action being taken against the appellant and other prosecution witnesses.
So no complaint was filed against them.
On appeal the High Court set aside the order of the Magistrate and directed the Magistrate concerned to file a complaint against the appellant in respect of offences under section 467 and section 467/120B of the Indian Penal Code as section 479A of the Code of Criminal Procedure had no application to the facts of the present case.
Held that section 479A had no application to prosecution for offences other than an offence under section 193 and cognate sections in Ch.
XI and that as regards other offences sections 476, 477, 478 and 479 of the Code of Criminal Procedure continue to apply even after the enactment of section 479A.
