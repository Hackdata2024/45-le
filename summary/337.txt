The provisions of the Representation of the People Act and the Rules framed thereunder assign distinct and different jurisdictions to the Election Commission and an Election Tribunal so far as a Return of election expenses is concerned.
Where there are allegations of major corrupt practices and a Tribunal constituted is in lawful seisin of the dispute, section 143 of the Act gives it the sole jurisdiction and makes it incumbent on it to inquire into the falsity of any particulars mentioned in the return where such falsity is alleged and brought into issue and is reasonably connected with the major corrupt practices.
What the Election Commission has to do under Rule 114(4) is to satisfy itself that the return is in the prescribed form.
It is no part of its function to inquire into the correctness of any particulars mentioned therein.
That question can only arise when some one raises a dispute and brings the matter into issue.
Consequently, in a case where, as in the present, the Election Commission removed the disqualification it had imposed on the returned candidate for lodging a defective return of election expenses on the lodging of a fresh return; Held, that the decision of the Election Commission removing the disqualification attaching to the first return in no way precluded the Tribunal from inquiring into the falsity of the particulars in the second return although they were identical with those challenged in the first return; that the removal of the disqualification only meant that the accepted return was the only valid return, being the first to be correct in form, and the Tribunal had only that return before it, 451
