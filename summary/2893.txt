The University of Agricultural Sciences Act, 1963, was passed by the Mysore State Legislature, to establish a University for the development of agricultural and allied sciences in the State.
Under section 7(4) of the Act, the control and management of such research institutions of the department of agriculture as the State Government might by order specify, were to be transferred to the University as and from the date specified; and, under sub section
(5), every person employed in such an institution, were, as from the specified date, to become an employee of the University on such terms and conditions as might be determined by the State Government in consultation with the Board of Regents of the University.
The respondent was holding a civil post under the State Government, having been appointed as a chemical assistant in the Agricultural Research Institute, Mandya, in the department of agriculture of the State.
In 1965, the control and management of the Institute was transferred to the University, by a notification under the Act.
On the question whether there was a removal of the respondent from a civil post in contravention of article 311, HELD : Whether the prospects of the respondent were or were not prejudicially affected is irrelevant.
For better or for worse, the notification resulted in the extinction of his status as a civil servant, and hence, his compulsory transfer to the University was void.
