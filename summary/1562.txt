In the year of account relevant to the assessment year 1942 43, the assessee received Rs. 9,180/ , but submitted no return of her income.
On July 25, 1949, the Income tax Officer, on receipt of definite information that such income had escaped assessment, issued a notice to her under section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, as amended by the Indian Income tax and Business Profits Tax (Amendment) Act, 1948.
Thereafter, she was assessed on the aforesaid income on October 24, 1949.
She challenged the validity of the proceedings under section 34 initiated on July 25, 1949, on the grounds, that the right to revive the assessment was governed by the provisions of section 34, before it was amended in 1948, under which the period of limitation prescribed was four years in the case of a failure to file a return and that this period having expired on March 31, 1947, and the Amending Act of 1948 having come into force only March 30, 1948, the eight years ' period provided therein could not be invoked.
For the Income tax Authorities, the validity of the notice was sought to be sustained by the additional ground that, in any case, section 31 of the Indian Income tax (Amendment) Act, 1953, validated the notice.
Held (per Sarkar, Hidayatullah and Reghubar Dayal, JJ., Das and Kapur,JJ., dissenting), that section 34 of the Indian Income tax and Business Profits Tax (Amendment) Act, 1948, was applicable to the proceedings in the present case and that the notice dated July 25, 1949, was valid.
138 Per Das and Kapur,JJ.
The limitation of eight years prescribed by section 34 as amended by the Amending Act of 1948 did not apply to the present assessee which was a case of failure to submit the return, when the period of four years had expired before March 30, 1948, when the amendment in section 34 was made by the Amending Act of 1948.
Section 31 of the %mending Act of 1953 did not enlarge the scope of the amended section 34, and did not validate the notice dated July 25, 1949.
Per Sarkar, J. By virtue of section 31 of the Amending Act of 1953, a notice issued and an order of assessment made in respect of a year ended before April 1, 1948, where the proceedings were commenced after September 8, 1948, were to be held valid if the notice was issued in accordance with sub s, (1) of section 34 as it stood after 1948 amendment and the assessment was completed in pursuance of such notice within the time specified in sub section
The notice and assessment in the present case satisfied all these conditions and, therefore, section 34 as amended in 1948 was applicable.
Such a notice and an assessment order valid under section 34 as amended in 1948 would be valid even if the time prescribed in respect of them by section 34 as it stood before the 1948 amendment had expired.
Per Hidayatullah and Raghubar Dayal, JJ.
The action was taken after 1948 amendment by which income, profits and gains which had escaped assessment by reason of the omission or failure of the assessee to make a return of the income could be brought to tax after serving a notice within eight years from the end of the relevant year.
Hence the notice in 1949 was within eight years from 1942 43 and was validly issued section C. Prashar, Income tax Officer vs Vasantsen Dwarkadas, [1964] Vol. 1 S.C.R. 29.
