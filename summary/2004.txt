The appellant 's father filed an application under section 64(1) of the Act for a declaration that the temple in question was a private one and did not fall within the purview of the Act, which was rejected by the respondent the Act and appointed members of the appellant 's family as heredity who declared the temple as a "public excepted temple" under section 6(5) of trustees.
Thereafter the appellant 's father filed a suit under section 64(2) of the Act for a declaration that the order passed by the respondent was illegal and should be set aside.
The Trial Court decreed the suit.
The appeal of the respondent was allowed by the High Court by accepting his preliminary ground that the suit was not maintainable as in the suit, the public were not impleaded in accordance with the requirements of 0.
I r. 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
