The Assistant Charity Commissioner, Bombay, held an enquiry under section 19 of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950 and came to the conclusion that the Nasik branch of the principal Shringeri Math situated in the State of Mysore was a public trust and liable to be registered under section 18 the Act.
The Charity Commissioner in appeal confirmed this finding and an application under section 72 to the District Judge by the respondent was rejected on the view that the institution at Nasik was a place of religious worship within the meaning of the definition in section 2(9) of the Act.
However, the High Court allowed an appeal and set aside the order of the Assistant Charity Commissioner.
On appeal to this Court by a certificate, HELD: The High Court was right in holding that the Nasik Math was not liable to be registered under the Act.
The High Court had found in the present case that in the Nasik Math no religious instructions were imparted and no spiritual service, was rendered to any body of disciples.
Furthermore, no member of the public was allowed to enter the place of worship without permission although worship was carried on by the Pujaris according to Vedic usage.
In view of these findings the Nasik Math could not be held to be a real Math or temple within the definition in section 2(9) of the Act.
[665 B D] HELD also: In order to determine the situs of ' the trust which consists of a Math and a subordinate so called Math or Maths, it ' is the situs of the principal Math which will determine the, applicability of the Act.
