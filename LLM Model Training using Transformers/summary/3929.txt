On a complaint by the Additional Registrar of the Madhya Pradesh High Court alleging that, while the Paper Book in the Supreme Court appeal was being prepared, the appellant entered, into a conspiracy with two of the translators of the Court and tampered with the of original deposition of one Dr. section C. Barat (D.W. 1) in an earlier criminal case against the appellant which was under appeal in the Supreme Court for which the aforesaid paper book was being prepared, the First Class Magistrate committed the appellant and two others to the Sessions Court to take their trial for offences under section 466 read with section 120 B of the Penal Code.
The appellant and another preferred a revision petition before the High Court against the said order of committal.
The High Court dismissed the revision petition.
Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court ^ HELD : 1.
An offence under section 466 I.P.C is covered by clause (c) of section 195(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code and comes within the purview of that section, as the offence under section 463 I.P.C. is dealt within section 466 I.P.C. Section 466 I.P.C. is on aggravated form of forgery in that the forgery should relate to a document specified in that section.
Section 466 I.P.C., is therefore an offence as described in section 463 I.P.C. which is committed in relation to a record or proceeding of or in a court of justice.
[390F, H, 391 A B] The offences that fall within the purview of section 195(1)(c) Criminal P C. are offences described in section 463 I.P.C. and offences punishable under section 471, 475 or 476 of the Penal Code.
The language of section 195(1) (c) of the Crl.
P.C. is very significant for while referring to sections 471, 475 or 476 I.P.C., it uses the word punishable in the case of section 463 I.P.C. the words are 'the offences described in section 463 '.
An offence under section 466 I.P.C. is an offence which falls within the description of section 463 I.P.C., as the offence under section 463 I.P.C. is dealt with therein.
[391B D] Section 195(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code uses the words "of any offences punishable under section 172. " while in clause (b), the words used are "offences punishable under any of the following sections mentioned therein".
In clause (e) the words are "of any offence described in section 463 or punishable under section 471, section 475 or section 476 of the same code".
Thus a clear distinction is maintained in the section between offences 386 punishable under various sections mentioned and the offence described in section 463.
Even on the test laid down in Govind Mehta vs State of Bihar , section 466 I.P.C. would be included within the purview of section 195(1)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
[391D E] Govind Mehta vs State of Bihar ; explained and over ruled.
The requirement; of section 195 (1)(c) is that the document in question should be produced or given in evidence in the proceeding before the Court.
The offence committed must in some manner have affected the proceedings or had been designed to affect them or come to light in the course of them, but an offence committed after their conclusion is wholly outside the scope of the provision.
