The appellant was appointed as Hindi Teacher in the M.E. School for a period of 89 days from July 12,1982 by the District Inspector (Schools) on the recommendation of the Managing Committee of the School.
He continued to serve the school with repeated spells of 89 day appointments and one day break in between the spells, till may 25, 1986.
He was not paid the salary for the period of summer vacations during all these years.
Although the appellant continues to serve the school to date under orders of the managing committee, but his appointment after 1986 was not approved by the educational authorities, in spite of the resolution of the managing committee dated July 6,1987.
The appellant filed a writ petition before the High Court claiming regularisation with effect from July 12,1982, contending that he was entitled to be regularsed in terms of the provisions of Section 3 of the Orissa Aided Educational Institutions (Appointment of Teachers Validation) Act, 1989.
The High Court dismissed the petition holding that the appellant was not entitled to the benefit of the Validation ACt, against which present appeal was filed by the appellant contending that his services were to be regularised with effect from July 12, 1982 under the provisions contained in Section 3 of the Validation Act.
Allowing the appeal, this Court, 991 HELD:1.1.
The Validation Act has been enacted by the Orissa Legislature with the obvious object of granting relief to those members of the teaching community who are being exploited for years together by keeping them in short spell appointments like 89 day appointments with one day break and in the process denying them their rightful dues and other service benefits.[994G 995A] 1.2 An appointment on 89 day basis with one day break which deprives a teacher of his salary for the period of summer vacation and other service benefits, is wholly arbitrary and suffers from the vice of discrimination.
The Validation Act covers the field upto December 31, 1984.
The State of Orissa will do well to consider the cases of all those who have completed one year or more as ad hoc teachers after December 31,1984 and come out with a scheme or any other appropriate measure to regularise their services.[995C D] 2.
To come with in the preview of the Validation Act the following conditions are to be satisfied: 1.
The appointment by the managing authority of the school on ad hoc basis must be on or after the 1st December 1976 but not later than 31st December 1984.
The services as such teacher is continuous for a period of at least one year without any break or with a break or breaks in one or more aided schools; 3.
Is continuing as such teacher or his services were terminated after the 31st December ,1984 save for misconduct.[995E G] 2.2.
The appellant was appointed on July 12,1982 and has been working with the approval of the authorities for almost 4 years with short breaks.
The managing committee is still utilising his services though there is no approval by the educational authorities for the period subsequent to 1986.
The case of the appellant is, thus, fully covered by Section 3 of the Validation Act.[995G 996A] 3.
The High Court erred in denying the benefit of the Validation Act to the appellant on the ground that his initial appointment for 89 days was conditioned by the stipulation that he would continue until replaced by a candidate from the select list.
The High Court read into the Act what was not there,[996A B] 992 Rattan Lal vs State of Haryana, A.I.R. 1987 S.C. 478, followed.
