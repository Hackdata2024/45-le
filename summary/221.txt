The contracts subsisted on ;he crucial dstes, November 15, 1951, and February 14, 1952.
November 15, 1951, was the last date for putting in, nominations and February 14, 1952, was the date on which results were declared : Held, that the candidate had both a share and an interest in the contracts for the supply of goods to the appropriate Government on the crucial dates and was thus disqualified for being chosen as a member of Parliament by virtue of the disqualification set out in section 7(d) of the Representation of the People Act (XLIII of 1951).
Held further, that the contention that the contracts in question were void because the Union Government could not be sued by reason of article 299(1) of the Constitution as the contracts were not expressed to be made by the President was without force because this was the type of case to which a. 230(3) of the Indian Contract Act would apply.
