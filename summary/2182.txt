The assessee was the managing agent of a Textile Mill in Uj jain.
In 1944, the Gwalior State promulgated the Gwalior War Profits Tax Ordinance.
In 1946, by the Gwalior War Profits Tax (Amendment) Ordinance, an Explanation was added after r. 3(2) of the First Schedule to the Ordinance of 1944.
In 1947, another Amendment Or dinance was promulgated whereby a comma was inserted in the Explanation.
In July 1944.
the assesses received about Rs. 11 lacs as dividend on its shares in the Textile Mill.
The War Profits Tax Officer included the amount in the assessee 's taxable income, and the order was upheld by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Commissioner.
On the question: whether the dividend income was chargeable to war profits tax, the High Court held, on a reference, that the Explanation applied and that under the Explanation the dividend income was not liable to be included in the assessee 's taxable income.
In appeal to this Court, it was contended that the Explanation was not applicable, because, (i) it was not retrospective; and (ii) it was only an Explanation to r. 3(2) and not to r. 3(1) which was the rule applicable to the assessee.
HELD:The Explanation applies to the computation of the pro fits of the chargeable accounting period, because: (i) the Ordinance of 1947 expressly assumes that the Explanation was in existence from the date when the War Profits Tax Ordinance came into force in 1944; and (ii) on the language of the Explanation it was meant to be an Explanation not only to r. 3(2) but also to r. 3(1).
By the words "in r. 3(2) the following shall be added", in the amending Ordinance of 1946, all that was meant was that the Explanation should be added below r. 3(2).
