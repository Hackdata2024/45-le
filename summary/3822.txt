A shop where Bhojnalaya was being run by the appellants tenants was demised to their predecessors in interest for the said purpose by the father of plaintiff respondent No. 1 in the year 1951 on a monthly rent of Rs. 50/ .
The father of the plaintiff respondent No. 1 was running a sweetmeat shop in a rented premises, the rent of which was Rs. 225/ per mensem.
The plaintiff 's father died in 1970.
Some time later the original tenant also died.
He had paid rent up to September, 1972.
The plaintiff served a notice on the defendants terminating the contractual tenancy with effect from 31 12 1972 and filed a suit an 8 3 1973 for eviction on the ground of bona fide necessity of the plaintiff, for arrears of rent amounting to Rs. 150/ for October, November and December 1972 and damages for the months of January and February 1973 at Rs. 225/ per mensem as also future damages till the delivery of the possession.
The trial court dismissed the suit holding that the plaintiff did not require the sweet shop bona fide for his personal necessity, On appeal by the plaintiff, the first appellate court by its judgment dated 11 8 75, taking a contrary view, decreed the suit for eviction, arrears of rent anti also for past and future damages at Rs. 125/ per month to be payable on and from 1 1 1973 until delivery of the vacant possession to the plaintiff.
The High Court in second appeal affirmed the decree.
Allowing the appeal by special leave in part, the Court, HELD : (1) Where a claim has never been made in the defence presented, no amount of evidence can be looked into upon a plea which was never put forward.
If it could be so even at the trial stage, undoubtedly such a new question of fact could not be entertained at in appellate stage.
In this case, neither any issue was struck nor was any evidence adduced by the parties on the question.
The case Pr to trial on the admitted footing that the business which the plaintiff wanted to shift to the suit shop was his business.
In such a situation it was not open to the appellants to take a stand at a very late stage of the litigation that the sweetmeat shop was the business of the joint family of the plaintiff and, therefore, not the plaintiff 's business to come within the meaning If clause (f) of sub s 1 of section 12 of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961.

(2)A tenanted shop in mere occupation of the landlord filing a suit for eviction against his tenant was sufficient to deny him a decree on the ground of clause(h) of section 4 of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act 1955 where the expression used was that the landlord "is not in occupation of any other accommodation in the city or town for that purpose".
But, under the 626 1961 Act, mere occupation of another premises is not sufficient in view of the clear departure made by using the phraseology in the second part of cl.
(f) of section 12(1), "the landlord has no other reasonably suitable non residential accommodation of his own in his occupation in the city or town concerned".
The premises must be his own meaning thereby that they must be owned by or belong to the landlord and he must be in occupation of the same.
In the instant case, the tenanted shop in occupation of the plaintiff was not sufficient to deny him a decree for eviction against his tenant section 12(1) (f) of the Act.[628E F] (3)As per the widened definition of "tenant ' in section 2(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961, a tenant even after the termination of his contractual tenancy does not become an unauthorised occupant of the accommodation but remains a statutory tenant.
A person continuing in possession of the accommodation even after the termination of his contractual tenancy is a tenant within the meaning of the Act and on such termination his possession does not become wrongful until and unless a decree for eviction is made.
If he continues to be in possession even after the passing of the decree, he does so as a wrongful occupant of the accommodation.

(4) If a suit is filed on the ground of non payment of rent after termination of the contractual tenancy, the tenant still continues to be tenant liable to pay rent not only for the past period, but in future also.
In absence of decree of eviction the person in occupation of the accommodation continues to be a tenant and is not liable to pay any damages as his occupation is not unauthorised or wrongful even after the termination of the contractual tenancy.
In the instant case (i) the defendants remained in occupation of the. accommodation on and from 1 1 1973 as a statutory tenant under the Act.
Their occupation was not unauthorised or wrongful until a decree for eviction was passed by the first appellate court on 11 8 1975.
Their occupation became unauthorised or wrongful only from that date.
They are liable to pay damages or mesne profits at Rs. 125/ per mensem from 11 8 1975 only until the delivery of the vacant possession of the accommodation.
They are not liable to pay any damages or mesne profits for the period commending from 1 1 1973 and ending 10 8 1975.
