% The respondent landlord filed a suit for eviction of the tenant from the suit premises on the ground of bona fide requirement under section 12(1)(e) of the M.P. Accommodation Control Act, 1961.
The appellant tenant contended that the respondent landlord was already in occupation of accommodation sufficient to meet his requirement and that the suit was filed in order to extract higher rent.
The trial court decreed the suit.
The first appellate court, applying the tests which appeared to it to be objective, found that the need in respect of suit accommodation was not a bona fide one and allowed the appeal of the appellant tenant.
E In second appeal by the respondent landlord, the High Court held that the first appellate court had drawn wrong inferences, that there was no proper appreciation of facts and that all the facts had not been borne in mind.
It allowed the appeal, restored the order of the trial court and ordered eviction.
Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: The need of the landlord must be reasonable and must be bona fide in order to evict the tenant on the relevant provisions of the various Acts.
Whether in a particular situation the need was reasonable or bona fide must be judged from the objective view point, not merely by assertion or denial of the parties.
[46E F] In second appeal, the scope of interference by the High Court is limited.
[47A] Mattulal vs Radhe Lal, ; , relied on.
45 In the instant case, prima facie, it might be possible to hold that the High Court was in error in interfering with the findings of the first appellate court.
But in view of the fact that subsequent to the decision of the High Court, the first wife of the landlord had died and the accommodation which was in her occupation has become vacant, and taking into cautious consideration the subsequent events, it must be held that there was no more bona fide need of the landlord to evict the tenant of the premises in question.
Order of eviction has, therefore, to be set aside.
