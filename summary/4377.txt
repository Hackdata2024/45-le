The deceased Bhagwan Singh who was working as an Amin put the appellant 's lands to sale for recovering certain arrears.
The appellant and his two companions Mool Chand and Daya Ram lay in wait for the deceased while he was on his way back home.
Daya Ram first fired three shots at the deceased as a result of which he fell down.
Immediately thereafter the appellant emerged with a sword and chopped off the head of Bhagwan Singh.
The appellant was convicted under section 302 read with section 34, I.P.C. and sentenced to death.
The second accused was still absconding.
On the question of sentence ^ HELD: There is no reason for commuting the sentence of death to the lesser sentence of imprisonment for life.
The deceased had to perform his ministerial duties as an amin in putting the land to sale.
He bore no personal grudge against the appellant nor had he anything to gain for himself by selling the appellant 's lands.
Such crimes against public servants for reasons arising out of the performance by them of their public duties must be put down with a firm hand.
[269E] The fact that the second accused was absconding does not reduce the gravity of the appellant 's offence.
