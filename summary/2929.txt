In a suit for possession of land court fee was held to be payable, under section 6(1) (v) of the Bombay Court Fees Act, 1959, on the value of the land.
On appeal, HELD : Under section 6(i)(v) in a suit for possession of land the court fee has to be calculated according to what has been provided in subclauses (a) (b) and (c) with regard to different categories of land.
It may be that in cl.
(v) the land which has not been assessed to land revenue is not covered by clause (a), (b) and (c) but then the court fee will have to be calculated under some other provision of the Act but not on the basis of the value of the land.
