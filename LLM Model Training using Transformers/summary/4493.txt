When a tenant has neither paid nor tendered the whole of the arrears of rent legally recoverable from him within two months of the date on which the notice of demand for the arrears of rent has been served on him by the landlord proviso (a) to section 14(1) empowers the Controller to make an order for the recovery of possession of the premises.
The proviso to section 14(2) states that no tenant shall be entitled to the benefit under the sub section if having obtained such benefit once in respect of any premises he again makes a default in the payment of rent of those premises for three consecutive months.
On 14th December, 1973, the land lady appellant issued a notice to the tenant stating that he had not paid the damages after May 1973 and called upon him to pay the arrears within two months from the date of notice.
The tenant remitted the rent to the land lady by money order towards the end of February 1974 but she refused to accept the same.
On the land lady 's application the Controller, and the Tribunal in appeal, held that the notice was valid and that the expression "damages for the use and occupation" meant nothing more nor less than rent.
But the High Court on appeal held that the term "rent" and "damages for use and occupation" could not be taken to be synonymous terms and that the notice issued by the land lady did not satisfy the requirements of clause (a) of the proviso to section 14(1) of the Act in that it did not demand rent from the tenant.
Allowing the appeal and remitting the case to the Court below ^ HELD: The notice issued by the land lady satisfies the requirements of clause (a) of the proviso to section 14(1).
[46 D] The High Court has taken an unnecessarily hypertechnical view of the contents of the notice which specifically stated that on account of the termination of the tenancy by an earlier notice the tenant had become a statutory tenant and it was in this context that a claim was made for damages for use and occupation at a rate equivalent to the agreed rent.
The demand so made could not be construed as anything but a demand for rent.
