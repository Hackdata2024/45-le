It is well settled that while Article 14 of the Constitution forbids class legislation, it does not forbid reasonable classification for the purposes of legislation.
In order, however, to pass the test of permissible classification two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (i) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group; and, (ii) that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question.
The classification may be founded on different bases; namely geographical, or according to objects or occupations or the like.
What is necessary is that there must be nexus between the basis of classification and the object of the Act under consideration.
Further Article 14 condemn,,; discrimination not only by a substantive law but also by a law of procedure.
The Constitution does not assure unanimity of decisions or immunity from merely erroneous action, whether by the courts or the executive agencies of a State.
Section 30 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not infringe the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution.
