After the estates and tenures of proprietors or tenure holders had passed to and became vested in the State by virtue of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, the Revenue Authorities interfered with the rights of those ex proprietors and ex tenureholders to hold Melas on lands which were occupied by them thereafter as occupancy raiyats and collected tolls from such Melas on behalf of the Government whereupon those intermediaries made applications to the High Court for writs restraining the Government from such interference which were allowed by the High Court.
During the pendency in this Court of these appeals preferred by the Officers of the State of Bihar against the order of the High Court the Bihar Land Reforms Amendment Act, 1959, was passed amending the Bihar Land Reforms Act of 1950 with retrospective effect by which the word Mela was added after the words jalkars, hats and bazars in section 4, cl.
(b) of the amended Act.
Further amendments provided inter alia that the State Government and not the intermediaries except with the consent of the State Government shall have the right to hold such Melas.
The main question arising for decision in these appeals and certain other applications made to this Court under article 32 of the Constitution of India was whether the amending legislation violated articles 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution.
Held, that the Bihar Land Reforms Amendment Act, 1959, is a law providing for the acquisition by the State of rights in an "estate" within the meaning of article 31A of the Constitution and even if it is assumed that it abridges the rights conferred by articles 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution its provisions are not void on that ground.
The amending legislation was within the legislative com petence of the Legislature under article 246 of the Constitution and after its amendment the legislative list permitted the State 383 Legislature to enact a law of acquisition even without a public purpose.
The State of Bihar vs Sir Kameshwar Singh, [1952] S.C.R. 889, considered.
