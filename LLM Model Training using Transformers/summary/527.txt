Respondent, an Income tax Officer, called an assessee to his house and took a sum of Rs. 800 from him.
Immediately afterwards a search was made and the respondent, after some evasion, produced the money.
The respondent 's defence was that he had taken the money as a loan and not as illegal, gratification.
The Special judge who tried the respondent found him guilty under section 16i, Indian Penal Code, and sen tenced him to six months simple imprisonment.
On appeal, the High Court acquitted the respondent.
The State obtained special leave and appealed.
Held, that the words used in article I36 of the Constitution show that in criminal matters no distinction can be made as a matter of construction between a judgment of conviction and one of acquittal.
The Supreme Court will not readily interfere with the findings of fact given by the High Court but if the High Court (i) A.I.R. (1954) S.C. 680.
581 acts perversely or otherwise improperly interference will be called for.
The findings of the High Court are halting and its approach to the case has been erroneous as it disregarded the special rule of burden of proof under section 4 Of the Prevention of Corruption Act (II Of 1947).
The judgment of the High Court shows that certain salient pieces of evidence were missed or were not properly appreciated.
In this situation the Supreme Court can interfere in an appeal by special leave.
Where it is proved that a gratification has been accepted, the presumption under s 4 Of the Prevention of Corruption Act shall at once arise.
It is a presumption of law and it is obligatory on the Court to raise it in every case brought under section 4.
The evidence and circumstances in this case lead to the conclusion that the transaction was not one of loan but of illegal gratification.
