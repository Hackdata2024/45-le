The appellant, who was an elector in the Shivaji Nagar Assembly Constituency in Pune, intended to contest the bye election to fill a seat in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly from the Jaoli Assembly Constituency in Satara district.
He applied to the Electoral Registration Officer of the Shivaji Nagar Assembly constituency for a certified copy of the relevant entry in the electoral roll containing his name, specifically mentioning that he required it for the purpose of producing it before the Returning Officer of Jaoli constituency under section 33(5) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 to enable him to file his nomination paper.
In the Shivaji Nagar assembly constituency a basic roll of electors had been prepared prior to 31.1.1984.
The name of the appellant was entered at Sl.
No. 16 of a supplement which was published on 31.1.1984.
Two more supplements were issued subsequently.
The basic roll and the supplements together constituted one integrated electoral roll which was published again on 29.1.1985.
The certified copy, which was furnished to the appellant on 8.1.1986, i.e., one day before the date on which he filed his nomination paper, was a copy made from the said integrated roll.
The Returning Officer of Jaoli constituency noted that in the certified copy produced the latest date of publication was given as 31.1.1984.
The Returning Officer told the appellant that since there were revisions subsequent to 31.1.1984, he had to produce another certified copy of the latest electoral roll at the time of secrutiny i.e. 11 O 'Clock on 11.1.1986.
The appellant rushed back to Pune and obtained another certified copy showing the latest PG NO 1063 PG NO 1064 date of publication as 29.1.1985, but reached the office of the Returning Officer of Jaoli constituency at about 1 P.M. on 11.1.1986.
In the meantime, the Returning Officer had already passed an order rejecting the nomination paper of the appellant on the ground of non compliance with the provisions of sub section (5) of section 33 and sub section (7) of section 36 of the 1951 Act.
The appellant requested review of the order but the Returning Officer declined stating that he had no power of review.
The High Court dismissed the appellant 's election petition holding: (1) that the appellant had not complied with section 33(5) of the 1951 Act as the certified copy produced by him was not a certified copy of the electoral roll in force at the time of election; (2) the certified copy produced on 11.1.1986 had been produced after the order of rejection of the appellant 's nomination paper had been passed, and (3) the Returning Officer had no power to review.
Allowing the appeal it was, HELD: (1) There is no prescription requiring the certified copy to state the several dates on which the basic roll or the supplement from which the copy is prepared had been published.
[1076F] (2) The Returning Officer had acted on his own information in rejecting the nomination paper of the appellant, namely, that there was a revision in 1985 and that the certified copy which had been produced was from an electoral roll which had become defunct.
If that was so, he should have secured the necessary material from the concerned Electoral Registration Officer and placed it before the appellant before rejecting his nomination paper.
[1077D E] (3) Unless the certified copy produced before the Returning Officer itself on the face of it showed that the electoral roll from which a certified copy had been prepared had been substituted by another electoral roll, the Returning Officer was not justified in not treating the production of the certified copy prepared on 8.1.1986 as sufficient compliance under section 33(5) of the 1951 Act, particularly having regard to the close proximity between the date of preparation and the date of the production of the certified copy.
[1077F H] (4) Under the proviso to section 36(5) of the 1951 Act, it is provided that in case an objection is raised by the Returning Officer or is made by any other person the candidate concerned may be allowed time to rebut it not PG NO 1065 later than the next day but one following the date fixed for scrutiny, and the Returning Officer shall record his decision on the date to which the proceedings had been adjourned.
The Returning Officer did not choose to wait even for a few hours on 11.1.1986 to give a chance to the appellant to make his plea that what had been produced along with the nomination paper was a certified copy which could be acted upon or to produce another certified copy which in fact he did produce at 1 P.M. on 11.1.1986 before the Returning Officer, even before the final list of candidates who had filed valid nomination papers, was published.
[1077B D] (5) Both the first certified copy and the second certified copy were copies of the same original.
Sub section (7) of section 36 of the 1951 Act lays down a rule of evidence.
It says that a certified copy of an entry in the electoral roll for the time being in force of a constituency shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that the person referred to in that entry is an elector for that constituency, unless it is proved that he is subject to a disqualification mentioned in section 16 of the 1950 Act.
[1078B C] (6) It is no doubt true that the electoral right is a statutory right and a person who wishes to contest an election should comply with the law applicable to elections strictly.
But in the instant case there is no default at all on the part of the appellant.
He had actually produced before the Returning Officer a certified copy which he had obtained within less than 24 hours from the Electoral Registration Officer of the constituency where he was residing and that he had not done anything to mislead the Returning Officer.
[1077E F] (7) The certified copy produced alongwith the nomination paper satisfied the requirement of section 33(5) of 1951 Act.
[1078D] (8) The appellant who was an innocent person had been denied the right to contest the election unreasonably.
The rejection of the nomination paper of the appellant was improper.
It follows that the election of the 1st respondent should be declared void in view of the provisions contained in section 100(1)(c) of the 1951 Act.
[1078E F]
