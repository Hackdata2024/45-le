A riot which was alleged to have a communal background resulted in the death of a person.
The trial court convicted the appellant and some others under section 302 read with section 149, I.P.C. The High Court, in appeal, convicted only the appellant under section 3020.
The High Court, while discarding the case of unlawful assembly as set up by the prosecution held the appellant guilty of murder only because the appellant was found lying injured near the scene of occurrence and had pleaded that he was attacked by a group of members of the Muslim community.
Allowing the appeal to this Court, HELD : The High Court had not given due importance to the fact that the appellant had serious injuries on his body.
The High Court dismissed his statement that he had only a stick with him without examining the credibility of his ver sion which was supported by the fact that only a stick was found near him; while the only injury on the deceased was caused by a sharp edged weapon.
It is not uncommon in cases of a communal nature to find witnesses coming forward to depose falsely about an attack by a person who is believed to be guilty, and, partisan witnesses may depose falsely out of a mistaken or misplaced sense of group loyalty.
In the present case, the participation of the appellant in the occurrence might have seemed to the witnesses to have been established by his having been found lying near the scene of occurrence in an injured condition.
This may be enough to convince unsophisticated persons of his complicity in the murder, but a court of justice has to sift and analyse the evidence very carefully, particularly in a case with a communal background, to determine whether the case against the accused is established beyond reasonable doubt.
