The appellant engaged an agent for the purposes of carrying on his business and conferred on him large powers of manage ment including authority to operate on bank accounts.
While acting under such authority the agent withdrew moneys from the bank and used them for the discharge of his personal debts.
The appellant was able to recover from the agent only a part of the amount misappropriated by him, and the balance had to be written off at the end of the accounting year as irrecoverable.
The question was whether the amount which was misappropriated and found irrecoverable was allowable as a deduction under the Indian Income tax Act in determining the profits of the appellant.
Held, that the amount in question is not allowable either as a bad debt under section 10(2)(Xi) or as a business expenditure under section 10(2)(XV) Of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922.
It can, however, be deducted in computing the profits of the appellant under 691 section 10(1) of the Act as a loss incidental to the carrying on of his business.
Where an agent or an employee of a businessman in charge of the business is given authority to operate on the bank accounts and withdraws moneys in the purported exercise of that authority, his action is referable to his character as such authorised agent or employee and any loss resulting from misappropriation of the money by him would be one incidental to the carrying on of the business, and it is not necessary to show that the money was withdrawn for the conduct of the business.
