The accused poured kerosene upon his mistress and set her clothes on: fire.
There were extensive burns and she died as a result thereof.
On the question as do the nature of the offence.
HELD : The accused must have known that he was committing an act so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or such injury as was likely to cause death.
As he had no excuse for incurring that risk the offence falls under section 300 (fourthly) of the Indian Penal Code, that is culpable homicide amounting to murder, even if the accused did not intend to cause her death.
[527 D E] Although the clause is usually invoked in those cases where there is no intention to cause the death of any particular person, it may, on its terms, be used in those cases where there is such callousness towards the result and the risk taken is such that it may be stated that the person knew that the act was likely to cause death or such bodily injury as was likely to cause death.
[527 C] Even though there is no provision to that effect in the Rules of the Supreme Court, in the case of an appeal by the State against acquittal for the major offence, it is safer, fair and just to the accused to give him a chance to prove that he was not guilty even of the lesser offence on the analogy of section 439(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
