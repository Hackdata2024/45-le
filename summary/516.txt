He was appointed by the administrator of Durgah Khwaja Saheb and was being paid Rs. 100 per month.
He was elected to the Council of States by the Electoral College of Ajmer and the unsuccessful candidate, the first respondent, challenged the election on the ground that the appellant wag holding an office of profit under the Government at the time of the election and was, therefore, disqualified to be chosen as a member of Parliament in view of article 102(1) (a) of the Constitution of India.
It was contended for the first respondent inter alia that as under sections 5 and 9 of the Act the Government of India had the power of appointment and removal of members of the committee of management as also the power to appoint the administrator in consultation with the committee, the appellant was under the control and supervision of the Government and that therefore he was holding an office of profit under the Government of India.
But the appellant was neither appointed by the Government of India nor removable by it nor was his salary fixed by the Government and it was paid out of the funds of the Durgah Endowment.
Held, that the appellant was holding his appointment under a committee which was a statutory body and could not be considered as the holder of an office of profit under the Government of India within the meaning of article 102(1) (a) of the Constitution of India.
Accordingly, the election of the appellant was valid.
