By a Notification under the Travancore Ancient Monuments Preservation Regulation (1 of 1112/M.E. 1936 37 A.D.), the State Government declared a fort wall, which was within certain property purchased by the petitioner, to be protected monument for the purposes of the Regulation.
The petitioner challenged the Notification as infringing his fundamental right under article 19(1) (f).
It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that the impugned Notification had no legal force as Regulation 1 of 1112/M.E., though validly made when it was passed, was impliedly repealed by the extension to the State in 1951 of the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904 (Central Act VII of 1904) as that Act covered the same field occupied by the State Government, and in any event there was an implied repeal of the Regulation by the Central Acts LXXI of 1951 and XXIV of 1958.
It was also contended that the disputed wall was not an ancient 'monument ' but fell within the term 'archaeological sites or remains ' and as the latter subject was in the Concurrent List, upon the extension of the Central Act VII of 1904 in 1951 to the State, the Central Act occupied practically the entire field covered by the State Act and thereby implicitly repealed the State Act.
HELD:By virtue of Entry 67 of the Union List, Parliament could make a law in respect of ancient and historical monuments declared by or under a law made by it to be of national importance, but the Central Act of 1904 did not embody the requisite declaration.
Therefore the Regulation, which fell under Entry 12 of the State List, continued to hold the field despite the extension of the Central Act to the State.
[873 F G] Similarly, the Central Acts LXXI of 1951 and XXIV of 1958 applied only to ancient or historical monuments specified in Part 1 of the Schedule to the 1951 Act or expressly notified by the Central Government under section 4 of the 1958 Act.
As neither of these Acts covered the monument in question, the State Regulation continued to be applicable in respect of it therefore followed hat the Notification issued under the State Act was valid.
[873 H; 874 A E] The contention based on the argument that the disputed wall was not a monument but an archaeological site or remain could not be accepted, because it was clear from the evidence before the court that the Fort wall was not an archaeological site for exploration and study but that it was 869 an existing structure surviving from a former period and, as such, a monument.
The State Government was therefore within its rights in issuing the impugned notification under section 3 of Regulation 1 of 11II 12/ M.E. [875 H; 876 A B]
