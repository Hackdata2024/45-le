The Income tax Officer, by his order dated October 9, 1952, assessed the respondent for the assessment year 1952 53 and gave him credit for Rs. 50,603 15 0 as representing interest on tax paid in advance under section 18 A(5) of the Income tax Act.
On May 24, 1953, the Indian Income tax (Amendment) Act, 1953, came into force adding a proviso to s.18 A(5) of the Act to the effect that the assessee was entitled to interest not on the whole of the advance tax paid by him but only on the difference between the payment made and the amount assessed.
The Amendment Act provided that it shall be deemed to have come into force on April 1, 1952.
The Income tax Officer, acting under section 35 of the Act, rectified the assessment order holding that the assessee was entitled to a credit of only Rs. 21,157 6 0 by way of interest on tax paid in advance as a result of the retrospective operation of the amendment in section 18 A(5), and issued a notice of demand against the assessee for the balance of Rs. 29,446 9 0.
The assessee filed a petition in the High Court of Bombay.
under article 226 of the Constitution praying for a writ prohibiting the appellants from enforcing the rectified order and notice of demand.
The High Court issued the writ holding that section 35 was not applicable to the case as the mistake mentioned in section 35 had to be apparent on the face of the order and the question could only be judged in the light of the law as it stood on the day when the order was, passed: Held, that the Income tax Officer was justified in exercising his powers under section 35 and rectifying the mistake.
As a result of, the legal fiction about the retrospective operation of the Amendment Act, the subsequently inserted proviso must be read as.
forming part of section 18 A(5) of the principal Act as from April 1, 1952, and consequently the order of the income tax Officer dated October 9, 1952, was inconsistent with the provisions of the proviso, and suffered from a mistake apparent from the record.
Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay Presidency and Aden vs 704 Khemchand Ramdas, (1938) L.R. 65 I.A. 236 and Moka Venkatap paiah vs Additional Income tax Officer, Bapatla, (1957)32 I.T.R. 274, referred to.
The order passed by the Income tax Officer under section 18 A was not final in the literal sense of the word; it was and con tinued to be liable to be modified under section 35.
It is also not correct to say that the retrospective operation of the amended s.18 A(5) was not intended to affect concluded transactions.
