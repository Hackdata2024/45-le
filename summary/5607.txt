% The first respondent, an employee of the appellant Corporation, who was to retire from his service on 1.6.89 on completion of 58 years of age as per the date of birth recorded in the register maintained by the employer, the appellant Corporation, filed a writ petition in the High Court claiming that his date of birth should be altered to 20th October, 1938, relying on a certificate issued by the Chief Medical Officer.
The petition was contested by the appellant Corporation.
A Single Judge of the High Court held that it was not possible to accept the case of the first respondent that he was born in the year 1938, and that the date of birth as recorded in the register of the appellant Corporation should not be interfered with.
However, taking into consideration the problems of the respondent, domestic or otherwise he made an order to the effect that the first respondent may be given three more years service after his due date of retirement by reappointing him for that period, as a special case.
Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: The Single Judge of the High Court having found that the date of birth of the first respondent as recorded in the register of the appellant Corporation should not be interfered with, committed a serious error in making an order directing the appellant Corporation, as a special case, to reappoint the first respondent for a period of three more years after his due date of retirement, on 1.6.89, on the ground that he had his problems, domestic or otherwise.
There was hardly any justification for passing such an order under Article 226 of the Constitution.
