The petitioners as partners of a registered firm were assessed to income tax for the relevant assessment years.
Thereafter they made a disclosure of their income under a "Voluntary Disclosure Scheme" regarding profits which had escaped assessment, and on reassessment of the disclosed income income tax, super tax and surcharge were levied.
The levy of surcharge but not income tax and super tax was challenged as unauthorised.
Held, that the power to legislate for levy of tax on income was conferred upon the Federal Legislature by section 100 sub sections (1) and (2) of the Government of India Act, 1935, and item 54 of List I of the Seventh Schedule and the Federal Legislature was competent under that entry to legislate in regard to the levy of a surcharge on tax; section 138(1) proviso (b) did not restrict the amplitude of that legislative power.
The term "Federal purposes" in section 138 is not defined in the Government of India Act nor in the ; but there is sufficient indication in the section itself that surcharges were to form part of the Revenues of the Federation and such Revenues were to be expended for the purposes therein mentioned.
The concept of the words "purposes of the Central Government" under the was not different from what was intended by the use of the words "Federal purposes" in section 138(i) proviso (b) of the Government of India Act.
