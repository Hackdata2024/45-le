The lands of the respondents were acquired for a scheme of the Appellant Improvement Trust.
The awards for compensa tion were made by the Collector on 6th January, 1979 and 30th April, 1982 and the reference was disposed of by the Land Acquisition Tribunal by its award dated 28th March, 1983 and 29th August, 1985 by granting solatium @ 15% on compensation and interest @ 6% on excess compensation.
In view of the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 the landowner claimants made an application to the Tribunal seeking enhanced solatium and interest under the amended provisions of Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
The Tribunal allowed the application by granting higher solatium, addi tional benefit of interest and interest on excess compensa tion.
The writ petitions filed by the Appellant Improvement Trust against the decision of the Tribunal were dismissed.
Hence these appeals by the Improvement Trust.
Allowing the appeal in part (C.A. No. 1894 of 1990) and dismissing the connected appeals, this Court, HELD: 1.
The benefit of higher solatium @ 30% under section 527 23(2) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 is applicable to cases of awards made by the Collector or the Court between 30th April, 1982 and 24th September, 1984.
In the instant case since the awards were made between the aforesaid dates the claimants have been rightly held entitled to enhanced solatium.
[530E] Union of India vs Raghubir Singh, ; , fol lowed.
Section 30(1)(a) of the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 clearly provides that the additional amount of interest provided under Section 23(1 A) of the Land Acquisi tion Act, 1894 shall be applicable to acquisition proceed ings pending before the Collector as on 30th April, 1982 in which he has not made the award before that date.
If the Collector has made the award before that date then addition al amount Cannot be awarded.
[531E] 2.1 The claimant in the Appeal (No. 1894 of 1990) is not entitled to additional benefit of interest under Section 23(1 A) because the award in this case was made long before 30th April, 1982.
But the claimant in the connected appeals are entitled to this benefit since in their cases the awards were made on 30th April, 1982 itself.
[531F; 532A] Union of India vs Raghubir Singh, , explained and held inapplicable.
Union of India vs Filip Tiago De Gama, J.T. 1989 4 S.C. 529, followed.
The award of interest on excess compensation is valid since the claimants were entitled to the same under section 28 as it stood amended by the Amending Act.
[530F] 4.
The order of the High Court and the Land Acquisition Tribunal in Civil Appeal No. 1894 of 1990 is therefore modified, only to the extent that interest shah be allowed at the rate of 6% per annum instead of 12% per annum.
The other additional benefits granted by the Tribunal shall remain in tact.
