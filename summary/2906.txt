The first respondent applied to the Deputy Commissioner, Lakhimpur for settlement of a Tea Garden for "special cultivation of tea".
In March, 1964 the Government of Assam permitted the settlement on payment of Rs. 3.86 lakhs as premium.
Upon the respondent failing to make payment of the amount, the State Government directed the auction of the tea garden.
The first respondent thereafter moved a petition in the High Court for a declaration inter alia that the State Government had acted illegally in fixing the amount of premium.
The High Court allowed the petition holding that the order fixing the premium was not in conformity with rule 40 framed under the Assam Land Revenue Regulations which required the State Government to fix the rate of premium for a particular locality; it did not empower the Government to fix the premium payable by an intending holder in a particular case.
On appeal to this Court, HELD : The High Court was in error in setting aside the order passed by the Government of Assam and in declaring that the offer to settle the tea garden on payment of the amount specified Rs. 3,86,000 was not in conformity with rule 40.
There was no warrant for the assumption made by the _High Court that in settling the premium to be fixed in respect of its own property, the Government is bound to fix the premium generally in respect of a region.
The Government is by the Act or the Rules not disqualified from fixing the premium to be paid in respect of an individual tea garden.
In the absence of any indication to the contrary a tea garden may appropriately be regarded as a locality within the meaning of Rule 40.
The rate of premium may be fixed by the State Government acccording to its commercial value.
