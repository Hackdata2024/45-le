On March 9, 1956, a conspiracy to divulge the budget proposals on receiving valuable consideration was discovered and a case was registered under section 165A of the Indian Penal Code, section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, section 5 of the Official Secrets Act, 1923, and section 120B of the Indian Penal Code.
Investigation started on March 10, 1956, and thereafter pardon was tendered to M by the Additional District Magistrate under section 337 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Owing to technical legal difficulties a complaint under section 5 of the Official Secrets Act read with section 120B of the Indian Penal Code was filed against the persons involved and proceedings began before a magistrate on this complaint.
In the course of these proceedings the prosecution wanted to examine M as an approver, but the accused persons objected that as the proceedings before the magistrate were only under section 5 of the Official Secrets Act read with section 12 OB of the Indian Penal Code and as no pardon could be tendered under section 337 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for these offences, M could not be treated as an approver but could be examined only as an ordinary witness.
It was contended for the prosecution that as the person to whom pardon was tendered was expected to tell the whole truth including details of other subsidiary offences committed in the course of the commission of the offence for which pardon was tendered, such pardon must be held to include the subsidiary offences though not of the nature mentioned in section 377(1), and therefore M could be considered as an approver in the present proceedings.
Held, that a pardon under section 377(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure could be tendered only with respect to the offences mentioned therein and that as section 5 of the Official Secrets Act read with section 120B of the Indian Penal Code was not covered by the words of section 337(1) no pardon could be granted for an offence of this nature.
Consequently, as the proceedings before the magistrate were only with respect to these offences, M could not be treated as an approver for the purpose of these proceedings.
