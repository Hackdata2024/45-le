In a revision filed by a private party, the High Court in its powers under section 439, Code of Criminal Procedure directed the retrial of the appellant, who had been acquitted by the Sessions Judge.
In doing so.
the High Court, went into the evidence very minutely, questioned every finding of the Sessions Judge, gave its own interpretation of the evidence de novo.
HELD: In setting aside an acquittal in a revision and ordering a retrial, there must exist a manifest illegality in the judgment of acquittal or a gross miscarriage of justice.
An interference in revision with an order of acquittal can only take place, if there is a glaring defect of procedure such as that the Court has no jurisdiction to court had shut out some material evidence which was admissible or attempt to take into account evidence which was not admissible or had overlooked some evidence.
Although the list given is not exhaustive of all the circumstances in which the High Court may interfere with an an, acuital in revision it is obvious that the defect in the judgment under revision must be analogous to those actually indicated by this Court.
