Section 123(7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, shows clearly that in order to amount to a corrupt practice the excess expenditure must be incurred or authorised by a candidate or his agent and the employment.
of extra persons must likewise be by a candidate or his agent.
The charge against the appellant was, inter alia, that the Manager, Assistant Manager, 20 Ziladars of Amethi and their peons and orderlies had worked for the appellant in connection with the election.
The view taken by the Election Tribunal that though the estate belonged to the father of the appellant, nevertheless as the appellant was the heir apparent and actually looked after the estate on behalf of the old and infirm proprietor, these servants of the estate were "virtually" his "own" servants and could properly be regarded as having been employed for payment by the appellant, was untenable because though section 77 of the Act uses the words SC who may be employed for payment", without indicating by whom employed or paid, the gist of a corrupt practice as defined in B. 123 (7) of the Act is that the employment of extra persons and the incurring or authorising of extra expenditure must be by the candidate or his agent.
The appellant accordingly, could not in the circumstances of the present case, be held to be guilty of any corrupt practice under section 123(7) as alleged against him and therefore could not be held to have been guilty of any minor practice under section 124(4) of the Act.
