A person accused of an offence under the Indian Penal Code and committed in a district which after the partition of India became part of Pakistan cannot be tried for that offence by a Criminal Court in India after his migration to India and acquiring thereafter the status of a citizen of India.
The fact that after the commission of an offence a person becomes domiciled in another country, or acquires citizenship of that State does not confer jurisdiction on the Court of that country retrospectively for trying offences committed and completed at a time when that person was neither the national of that country nor was he domiciled there.
According to section 4 'of the Indian Penal Code and section 188 of the Code of Criminal Procedure if at the time of the commission of the offence the person committing it is a citizen of India then even if the offence is committed outside, India he is subject to 698 the jurisdiction of the Courts in India, as qua citizens the jurisdiction of Courts is not lost by reason of the Venue of an offence.
If, of however, at the time of the commission of the offence the accused person is not a citizen of India these sections have no application at all.
The term "domicil" does not admit of an absolute definition.
The simplest.
definition of domicil is: That place is properly the domicil of a person in which his habitation is fixed without any present intention of removing therefrom.
The fact is that the term domicil can be illustrated but cannot be defined.
