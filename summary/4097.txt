The respondent sold his house at a price sufficient to attract capital gins but he pre empted the demand of tax by acquiring the common house from his brothers for a consideration of Rs 30,000/ each through separate release deeds.
On behalf of the Petitioner, it was contended that release deeds by sharers in favour of one of them amounts to purchase within the meaning of section 54 (1) of the Act.
The High Court having held it is, the Revenue came by way of Special Leave.
Dismissing the Petition, ^ HELD: Each release is a transfer of the releaser 's share for consideration to the release.
In plain English, the transferee purchases the share of each of his brothers for a price.
Had this been taken from non fraternal owners of shares or from one stranger owner, plain spoken people would have called it a purchase.
The reason is supported by decision in Hobshaw Brothers Ltd. vs Mayer, [1956(3) AER 833 and 835] that purchase primarily means acquisition for money paid, not adjusted.
There is no reason to divorce the ordinary meaning of the word 'purchase ' as buying for price or equivalent of price by payment in kind or adjustment towards an old debt or for other monetary consideration from the legal meaning of that word in section 54(1) of the Act.
