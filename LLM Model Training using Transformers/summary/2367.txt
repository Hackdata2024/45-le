A stock of bottles apparently containing cosmetic preparations was found from the possession of the respondent.
On analysis the bottles which were taken as samples were found to contain alcohol and as the respondent did not have any licence for possessing alcohol he was Pro secuted under section 66(b) of the Bombay Prohibition Act.
The trying Magistrate acquitted him.
on the ground that he did not hold the bottles on his own but only as the agent of a wholesale dealer who acknowledged his ownership.
While acquitting the respondent the Magistrate ordered the confiscation of the remaining bottles under section 98 of the Prohibition Act.
The respondent went to the High Court against the order of confiscation.
The learned Single Judge ordered return of the bottles because according to him it was not proved that the 1500 and odd other bottles also con tained intoxicants, and therefore the order under section 98 of the Act was illegal.
The State appealed, HELD : Under section 98 what has to be seen is whether an offence under the Prohibition Act in respect of the property in question has been committed or not.
An offence may be demonstrated to be committed although the accused who committed it may not be successfully prosecuted.
On proof that there is a contraband article in respect of which an offence has been committed the obvious course is to confiscate, it to the State.
Therefore in the present case if the court was satisfied that the bottles contained contraband article the bottles could be confiscated.[449C E] [Order of the High Court set aside with the direction that a few bottles at random should be analysed and if contraband stuff against the prohibition act was found the whole stock should be confiscated.]
