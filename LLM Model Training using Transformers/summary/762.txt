The appellant an Indian citizen entered India without a passport after and on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court.
The appellant 's contention was that section 3 of the Indian Passport Rules, 1950, were ultra vires the Constitution and that on a proper interpretation, the provisions of the section and rules did not apply to an Indian citizen; and that when a case involves a constitutional question, it should be referred to a Bench of five judges, described as " Constitution Bench.
" Held: Where there is a binding decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court on the question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, and if the same question is raised in another matter then it cannot be said that any substantial question of law arises regarding the interpretation of the Constitution and the matter need not be referred to a Constitution Bench.
On a reasonable interpretation of section 3 of the Act and rr. 3 and 4 of the rules, which say that " persons " entering India shall be in possession of a valid passport, there can be no manner of doubt that the provisions apply to all persons entering India including Indian citizen.
The Act of entry into India without a passport was in contravention of the Rules and the appellant was rightly convicted.
