The appellant company was assessed to tax in the assessment years 1948 49, to 1953 54, in respect of its profits, and was allowed rebate on the undistributed profits.
It was resolved to voluntarily wind up the company with effect from October 1, 1957.
The liquidator, during the years 1957 to 1959 distributed, from time to time, the accumulated profits to the shareholders and also issued income tax refund certificates.
The Income tax Officer, under section 35(10) of the Income Tax Act, 1922, withdrew the rebate granted in respect of each of the assessment years 1948 49 to 1953 54 and demanded payment of tax.
The company applied for a writ quashing the order, but the High Court dismissed the petition.
In appeal to this Court, the company contended that : (i) Section 35(10) did not authorise the Income tax Officer to bring to tax the amount on which rebate tax was granted in assessment years commencing prior to 1st April 1956, and (ii) the distribution by the liquidator of accumulated profits could not be regarded as declaration of dividend by the company within the meaning of section 35(10).
HELD : (i) The power to withdraw rebate was exercisable within 4 years from the end of the financial year in which the amount on which rebate was allowed was availed of by the company for declaring dividends.
1735 B C] Ahmedabad Manufacturing and Calico Printing Co. Ltd. vs S.G. Mehta, [1963] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 92, followed, (ii) Distribution of accumulated profits by the liquidator together with the income tax refund certificates, in the course of voluntary winding up, can be regarded as declaration of dividend, so as to attract the applicability of provisions enabling the withdrawal of rebate and demand for tax.
[739 C] On the passing of a resolution for voluntary winding up the company does not stand dissolved and its property does not vest in the liquidator.
lit distributing the assets, including accumulated profits, the liquidator acts merely as an agent or administrator for and on behalf of the company.
Therefore, distribution by the liquidator is distribution by the company.
[736 B C, E] There is nothing in section 35(10) which suggests that the expression dividend was to have a meaning different from the meaning assigned to it by section 2(6A) in the interpretation clause.
By the omission of the proviso to section 2(6A)(c) by the Finance Act, 1955, distribution of accumulated profits, whether capitalised or not and without any restriction as to time, was brought within the definition of dividend.
The provisions of sections 35(10) and 2(6A)(c) are part of a single scheme to declare distribution of accumulated profits, capitalized or not, as dividends, and 733 to bring the undistributed profits on which rebate was granted to tax, if availed of by the liquidator of the company for distributing dividends.
[737 F, H; 738C D] Power under section 35(10) may be exercised if accumulated profits are availed of by the company "for declaring dividends in any year", that is, after following the procedure in article 95 of Table A of the Companies Act, 1913, under which the assessee was registered.
But, the distribution made by the liquidator, was a distribution of interim dividend, and, in the matter of distribution of interim dividend, the Companies Act does not set up any special machinery nor does it impose any special condition before power in that behalf may be exercised.
