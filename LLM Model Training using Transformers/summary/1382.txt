The company accepted the resignation of one of its directors and in appreciation of his long valuable services to the company, paid him a gratuity of Rs. 40,000/ .
This amount was claimed as a deduction under section 10(2) (xv) of the Income tax Act which was disallowed by the Income tax Officer, on the ground that the appellant company had no pension scheme; the payment was voluntary and that the entry in the assessee 's books clearly indicated it to be a capital payment.
^ Held, that the payment does not fall within the provisions of section 10(2)(xv) of the Act.
The amount was paid not in pursuance of any scheme of payment of gratuities nor was it an amount which the recipient expected to be paid for long and faithful service but it was for a voluntary payment not with the object of facilitating carrying on the business of the appellant company or as a matter of commercial expediency but in recognition of long and faithful service.
There Was no practice in the appellant company to pay such amounts to and did not affect the quantum of salary of the recipient.
To claim a deduction under section 10(2)(xv) of the Act the proper test to apply is, was that the payment made as a matter of practice which affected the quantum of salary or was there an expectation by the employee of getting a gratuity or was the sum of money expended on the ground of commercial expediency and in order indirectly to facilitate the carrying on of the business.
