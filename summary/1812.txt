On October 10, 1953, the respondents filed suits under section 232 read with section 20 of the U. P. Zamindari Abolition, and Land Reforms Act, 1950 against the appellant before the Sub Divisional Officer.
Before the coming into operation of the Abolition Act the appellant (Amba Prasad) was Zamindar of the disputed land.
The names of the respondents were recorded in column 23 (miscellaneous) in the Khasra for the year 1356 Fasli as persons in possession of the disputed land.
The respondents claimed adhivasi rights under section 20 of the Abolition Act because they were recorded as occupants of the fields in dispute in the Khasra for 1356 Fasli.
The common case of the respondents was: (i) that they were in possession of the suit land (ii) that they were dispossessed after June 30, 1948 by the appellant, (iii) that as they were recorded occupants in 1356F they were not required to prove actual possession.
The case of the appellant was that the entry was fraudulently made after July 1, 1949.
These suits were dismissed by the Sub Divisional officer.
On appeal, the Additional Commissioner held that the respondents had acquired the adhivasi fights.
Against this order Amba Prasad (the appellant) appealed to the Board of Revenue.
The Board of Revenue dismissed the appeals.
The appellant then filed appeals in this Court.
Held:(i) Under section 20 of the Abolition Act (U. P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act) a person continues as an adhivasi after July 1, 1952.
provided he is in possession or was evicted after June 30, 1948.
If he was evicted after June 30, 1948 he is entitled to regain possession in spite of any order or decree to the contrary.
(ii)The words "recorded as occupants" in section 20 of the Abo lition Act mean persons recorded as occupants in the Khasra or Khatauni for 1356 Fasli (1 7 48 to 30 6 49).
Such persons do not include an intermediary.
The word "occupant" must mean a person holding the land in possession or actual enjoyment.
Mediate possession (except where he immediate possessor holds on behalf of the mediate possessor) is of no consequence.
(iii)The appellant was not entitled to raise the plea of the correctness of the entry in Khasra because the entry was not corrected before the date of vesting (1 7 52) as required by Explanation (ii) to section 20 of the Abolition Act.
(iv)The title to possession as adhiwasi depends on the entries in the Khasra or Khatauni for the year 1356 Fasli.
Section 20 of the Abolition Act does not require the proof of actual possession.
Therefore, section 20 eliminates inquiries into disputed possession by accepting the record in the Khasra or Khatauni of 1356F. or its correction before July 1, 1952.
