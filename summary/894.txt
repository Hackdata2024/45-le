Section 117 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 provided: " The petitioner shall enclose with the petition a Government Treasury receipt showing that a deposit of one thousand rupees has been made by him. in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission as security for the costs of the petition." The respondent, who filed an election petition challenging the validity of the appellant 's election, deposited the amount as required under section 117 of the Act.
In the deposit receipt, the words " Secretary to the Election Commission " were put in as against the name of the person on whose behalf money was paid.
The appellant contended that the receipt in this form showed that the money had been paid by the respondent acting for the 517 Secretary to the Election Commission and not by him in favour of the latter, and that as the receipt was, therefore, not in terms Of section 117, the election petition should be dismissed.
The Tribunal accepted the appellant 's contentions and dismissed the election petition under the provisions of section 90(3) of the Act.
Held, that the words " on whose behalf " in the deposit receipt, in the context, must mean " in whose favour " and that the receipt was in full compliance with section 117 of the Act.
Held, further, that the order passed by the Tribunal under the powers contained in section 90(3) Of the Act dismissing the election petition is an order under section 98 and is appealable under section 116A.
The word " trial " in section 98 of the Act means the entire pro ceeding before the Tribunal from the reference to it by the Election Commission to the conclusion.
