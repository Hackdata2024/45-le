A consent decree was passed against the assessee awarding maintenance to his wife and children.
The decree did not create any charge upon the income of the assessee.
The assessee claimed in the assessment of income tax deduction of the amount paid under the decree from his total income.
Held, that the assessee was not entitled to the deduction.
Where by the obligation income was diverted by an overriding title before it reached the assessee, it was deductible; but where the income was required to be applied to discharge an obligation after such income reached the assessee, it was not deductible.
The true test was whether the amount sought to be deducted, in truth, never reached the assessee as his income.
In the present case, the wife and children of the assessee received a portion of the income of the assessee, after the assessee had received the income as his own.
