The respondent who bad not been assessed to income tax prior to the assessment year 1948 49 made suo motu returns on July 4, 1949, showing an income of Rs. 4,494 and Rs. 31,646 respectively, for the assessment years 1948 49 and 1949 5o, but failed to send an estimate of the tax on his income as provided in section 18A(3) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922.
The Incometax Officer took action under section 28 read with section 18A(9) of the Act and imposed a penalty on him for the years 1948 49 and 1949 50. 395 The Appellate Tribunal held that the order imposing the penalty was ultra vires on the ground that section 28 would, in terms, apply only when a person failed to furnish the return when he was required so to do by notice under section 22 or section 34 of the Act, and that there could be no such notices with reference to estimates of tax on income to be sent under section 18A(3).
The High Court, on reference, agreed with the view of the Tribunal.
Held, that in view of the legal fiction contained in section 18A(9) of the Act that when an assessee has failed to comply with section 18A(3) he "shall be deemed to have failed to furnish the return of his total income and the provisions of section 28, so far as may be, shall apply accordingly ", the failure to send an estimate of the tax under section 18A(3) should be treated as failure to furnish return of income under section 22.
Accordingly, it was competent to the Income tax authorities to impose a penalty under section 28 read with section 18A(9)(b) where there has been a failure to comply with section 18A(3).
The relevant provisions of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, are set out in the judgment.
