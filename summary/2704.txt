Under a contract dated August 3, 1957 the defendant agreed to sell to the plaintiffs 40,000 tons of float iron lying in a mining area in the Hosadurgo Taluka in Mysore State, and gave, them a right to win and remove iron ore.
On September 2, 1957, the defendant wrote to the plaintiffs that further to the agreement dated August 3, 1957, he agreed to assign the said lease area of 184 acres for iron and manganese ores to the plaintiffs subject to their paying one lakh and eighty thousand rupees within three months.
The three months expired on November 6, 1957 without the offer being accepted by the plaintiffs orally or by letter.
On October 31, 1957 the defendant posted a letter to the plaintiffs revoking the offer, which reached them on November 6, 1957.
The plaintiffs instituted a suit (O.S. No. 55 of 1957) against the defendant alleging that by contract dated September 2, 1957 the defendant had agreed to assign to the plaintiffs his leasehold interest in the aforesaid 184 acres of land and claiming specific performance of the contract.
The trial court decreed the suit.
The defendant appealed to the High Court.
On the question whether the offer made in the defendant 's letter of September 2, 1957 had been accepted by the plaintiffs the High Court held that the plaintiffs had accepted the said offer in their plaint in another suit relating to the possession of the same land (O.S. No. 46 of 1957) a copy of which was served on the defendant on November 5, 1957 a day earlier than the defendant ' s letter revoking the offer reached the plaintiffs.
Despite this finding, on another ground, the High Court allowed the defendant appeal and dismissed the suit, namely, O.S. No. 55 of 1957.
The plaintiff appealed with certificate to this Court.
HELD : The appeal must be dismissed on the ground that there was no concluded contract between the parties.
[585 C D] The letter dated September 2, 1957 sent by the defendant to the plaintiffs, though worded as an agreement was in point of law an offer only.
The defendant was at liberty to revoke the offer at any time before its acceptance by the plaintiffs.
The defendant 's letter revoking the offer reached the plaintiffs on November 6. 1957.
Before that date the plaintiffs did not accept the offer either orally or by letter.
The High Court was wrong in holding that the plaintiffs accepted the offer by their plaint in O.S. No. 46 of 1957 and that this acceptance was communicated to the defendant before November 6, 1957.
[583 B B] Considering the contents of its relevant paragraphs the plaint in question was not in point of law an acceptance of the offer, nor was it intended to be an acceptance.
It is not usual to accept a business offer by a plaint; nor is it usual to communicate an acceptance by serving a copy 592 of the plaint through the medium of the Court.
To hold thus would be straining the language of s section 2(6), 3 and 7 of the Contract Act.
[585 A B] The old chancery practice under which the mere filing of a bill in a suit to enforce specific performance was regarded as sufficient acceptance of the defendant 's offer unless the offer had been withdrawn before the filing of the suit, cannot be applicable under the present Indian practice and procedure.
[585 C E] The argument based on Bloxam 's case that the communication of an assent was not necessary and mere mental assent of the plaintiffs to the defendant 's proposal was sufficient.
was misconceived.

In re : Pellatt 's case, , applied.
