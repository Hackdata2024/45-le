The respondent was manufacturing printed bulb cartons and printed tube cartons for the purpose of packing electric bulbs and electric tube light.
The Additional Collector of Central Excise held that the cartons manufactured by the respondent were classifiable under item No. 17 of the Cen tral Excise Tariff Act and thus chargeable to excise duty.
Accordingly an order was passed for demand of excise duty.
The respondent filed an appeal before the Customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal.
The Tribunal allowed the appeal by holding that (i) The product drums or sleeves manufactured by the respondent could not be called 'box ' or 'carton '; (ii) They were exempted from excise duty under the relevant notification.
Hence this appeal by the Revenue.
Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1. To consider the question whether the exemption notification was applicable or not in view of its terms, it is necessary to find out whether these sleeves bulbs or sleeves or tube light sleeves manufactured for the purpose of packing the electric bulbs and tubes are printed box and cartons.
[127E] 2.
The Tribunal approached the question from the literal meaning as well as the functional use of the expressions employed.
As these 124 sleeves and tube sleeves manufactured by the respondent had no independent market as such, and as these were utilised for captive consumption for the end product manufactured by the respondent, in the absence of any positive and reliable evidence that there was either a market for these goods manufactured by the respondent, and in that market these bulb sleeves and tube sleeves are known and marketable as corrugated boxes and cartons, a fact of which in the record, there is no positive evidence either way, the Tribunal proceeded on a correct basis.
Therefore, the conclusion reached by the Tribunal cannot be assailed in this appeal.
