% Section 630 of the empowers the court, on the complaint of the Company, or any creditor or contributory thereof, to punish an officer or employee of such company, by levy of fine, if such officer or employee wrongfully obtains possession of, or having obtained possession, wrongfully withholds or knowingly misapplies, the property of the company, and also order him to deliver up or refund, within a stipulated time, such property or, in default, to suffer imprisonment.
In these appeals against the Judgment of the High Court, the question for consideration was as to the scope and interpretation of this provision.
E Allowing the appeals, ^ HELD: Section 630 of the plainly makes it an offence if an officer or employee of a company who was permitted to use the property of the company during his employment, wrongfully retains or occupies the same after the termination of his employment.
It is the wrongful withholding of such property, meaning the property of the company after termination of the employment, which is an offence under section 630(l) of the Act.
[785B C] There is, therefore, no warrant to give a restrictive meaning to the term "officer or employee" appearing in sub section (1) of section 630 of the Act as meaning only the existing officers and employees and not those whose employment has been terminated.
