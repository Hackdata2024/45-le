The appellant contractor claimed a sum of Rs.3,87,796 before the sole arbitrator on April 5, 1977 for the value of 15 items of works not paid.
To this he added interest to the tune of Rs.2, 95,894 at 18 per cent from the date which according to him each of the claims should have been set tled, making a total of Rs.6,83,690.
He also prayed for further interest at 18 per cent from April 6, 1977 till date of award and thereafter until payment.
The respondent State filed its written statement and the arbitration proceedings continued for some time.
But before the arbitrator could make an award, an application under sections 8(2) and 12 of the Arbitration Act was filed before Subordinate Judge who by his order removed the arbitrator and appointed another person as the sole arbitrator.
The new arbitrator entered on the reference, got all the records from the previous arbi trator and continued the hearing.
The appellant made a supplemental claim for a sum of Rs.8,27,857 and also prayed for interest on that amount at 18 per cent from October 14, 1973 till date of payment.
The respondent State objected to the entertainment of additional claim.
The arbitrator, however, proceeded with the hearing.
On November 8, 1981, the day the hearing was closed, the appellant contractor filed one consolidated 'abstract ' of his two claim state ments showing a total claim of Rs.31.44.437 and also prayed for interest at 18 per cent per annum from November 9, 1981 till the date of payment.
The arbitrator made an award on December 7, 1981 allow ing a lump sum of Rs.25,00,156 together with interest at 9 per cent after the expiry of 30 days from the date of making the award, till the date of payment or decree whichever was earlier.
The award was made a decree of the court.
The court, however, disallowed interest from the date of decree till realisation.
349 On appeal by the respondent State the High Court came to the conclusion that the award was vitiated by non applica tion of mind amounting to legal misconduct.
In that view, it set aside the award and remitted the matter back to the Arbitration Tribunal constituted under section 41A of the Arbi tration Act, as amended by Orissa Act 3 of 1983.
Dismissing the appeal, the Court, HELD: 1.1 Though the arbitrator is not bound to disclose as to what interpretation he has made and what inference he has derived from the documentary evidence, he is bound to refer in the award that he had considered all the documents placed before him, no matter whether he relies on them or discards them from consideration.
[353A] 1.2 In the instant case, the arbitrator in his award ex facie did not mention that he had referred to or consid ered the documents placed before him in respect of the original claim.
The order sheet mentions about the nearing on different dates relating to tile supplemental claim statement which was filed before him.
It was this argument in respect of the supplemental claim that has been mentioned in the award.
[353B] 2.1 The arbitrator in case of a reference to him in pursuance of an arbitration agreement between the parties, being a person chosen by parties is constituted as the sole and final judge of all the questions and the parties bind themselves as a rule to accept the award as final and con clusive.
Even in a case where the arbitrator does not give any reason or he commits a mistake either in law or in fact in determining the matter referred to him and such a mistake does not appear on the face of the award, the same cannot be assailed.
It could be interfered with only in limited cir cumstances as provided under sections 16 and 30 of the Act.
The court has, therefore, to test the award with circumspection.
1354F, E, G] 2. 2 All the same, if the amount awarded is dispropor tionately high having regard to the original claim made and the totality of the circumstances, it would certainly be a case where the arbitrator could be said to have not applied his mind amounting to legal misconduct.
[354G H] State of Orissa vs Dandasi Sahu, ; , referred to.
In the instant case, in the original claim made before the arbitrator the value of the work not paid was stated as Rs.3,87,796.
The supplemental claim made before the arbitrator amounted to 350 Rs.8,27,857.
Thus, the total value of work not paid, accord ing to the appellant, was Rs.12,15,653.
As against this claim, the arbitrator had awarded a lump sum of Rs.25,00,156.
No doubt, the appellant had asked for payment of interest and including interest his claim was Rs.31,44,437.
[354H; 355A] 2.3 Where a reference to arbitration was made prior to the commencement of the which came into force on August 19, 1981 the arbitrator is not empowered to grant interest for the period upto the date of submission of the claim or the period during which the dispute was pending before the arbitrator, and where the award granted a lump sum amount it shall deem to have included the interest also if interest had been claimed before the arbitrator and the inclusion of such interest would render that part of award invalid.
[355B C] In the instant case, if the interest portion is exclud ed, then it becomes evident that award of Rs.25.00,156 suffers from the vice of giving disproportionately high amount.
[355C D] 2.4 Since the award suffers not merely on the ground that it included interest but also on the ground of non application of the mind the question of setting aside only the invalid part relating to the grant of interest does not arise.
[355F G] State of Orissa vs Niranjan Swain, [1989] 4 SCC 269, distinguished.
