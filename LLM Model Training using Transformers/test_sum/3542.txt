The High Court issued a notice against the appellants; making out a case of criminal contempt of court.
The appellants tendered a conditional apology contingent on the courts finding their action to be contempt of court.
The apology was accepted.
Allowing the appeals and dropping the contempt proceedings, the Court.
HELD: (1) The elementary basis of acceptance of apology is that there is to be a finding of committal of contempt.
The Full Bench fell into the error of accepting the apology without finding that the appellants committed any contempt In the absence of such a finding, no question arises for acceptance of apology.
F G] (2) Judges are, by reason of their office and nature of work, expected not to get involved in controversial matters, or to concern themselves with political issues or policies undertaken by political parties.
If any Judge addresses on political problems or controversies, the Judge exposes himself to discussion by public.
He cannot in such a case take shelter behind his office if the public discusses and criticises the views expressed by him, and the protective umbrella of the court cannot be used by way of bringing the critics on the charge of contempt of Court.
