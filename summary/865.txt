C, who was the Karta of the Hindu undivided family con sisting of his wife, three sons and himself, was a partner in six managing agency firms in six Mills, and the income received by him as partner 'was being assessed as that of the Hindu undivided family for the purposes of income tax.
On December 31, 1945, C, acting for his three minor sons and himself, and his wife entered into an oral agreement for a partial partition, with effect from January 1, 1946, by which C gave a certain share to his daughter in the managing agency commission from two of the six managing agencies held by the family and the balance together with the share* in the other managing agencies was divided into five equal shares between C, his wife and sons.
The agreement was subsequently recorded in a document dated September II, 1946, which recited, inter alia: " By this partition we decided that whatever commission fell due till 31 12 45 and which is received after 31 12 45 should be kept joint and in respect of the commission which accrues from 1 1 46 and received after that date each of us become absolute owner of his one fifth share and therefore from the date, i.e., from 1 1 46 these commissions cease to be the joint property of our family.
" For the assessment years 1947 48 and 1948 49, C claimed that the income from the managing agency firms should no longer be treated as the income of the Hindu undivided family but as the separate income of the divided members, but the Income tax authorities rejected the claim on the grounds that by the document in question the division was of the income and not of the assets from which the income was 297 derived and since income tax was payable at the moment of time when income accrued, this income must be taken to have accrued to the Hindu undivided family: Held, that inasmuch as there was no other effective mode of partitioning this asset and further in view of the finding that the partition was not a pretence, the asset must be treated as divided for purposes of income tax law and the income was not assessable as the income of the Hindu undivided family.
