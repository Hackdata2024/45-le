During the Second WOrld War the property in dispute was requisitioned by the Collector for the purpose of construc tion of a military aerodrome.
As there was extreme urgency, the possession of the property was taken on 1 10 1942 and to regularise the possession the Collector issued an order on 8 6 1943 under sub rules (1), (2) and (5) of Rule 75A of the Defence of India Rules, 1939 framed under the Defence of India Act, 1939 requisitioning the property.
The owner of the property, predecessor in interest of the claimants, submitted claim petitions claiming a total sum of Rs.2,40,720 as compensation.
The Special Land Acquisition Collector awarded a sum Of Rs.11,878.50 as recurring compe nation for 1349 to 1359 B.S. i.e. (1942 to 1952).
The Dis trict Judge acted as Arbitrator to determine the compensa tion and he awarded a sum of Rs.4,44,691 as compensation, The Union of India preferred appeal and the claimants pre ferred cross objection to the appeal in the High Court against the Arbitrator 's award.
The Division Bench dismissed the appeal and allowed the cross objection by enhancing compensation to Rs.18,74,089.75 for the period 1 10 1942 to 1 10 1969.
In the appeal to this Court on behalf of the appellant Union it was contended that the High Court committed error in awarding recurring compensation to the claimants for the period beyond 15 4 1955 as the claimants ceased to have any right, title or interest in the property in dispute, as the same vested in the State with effect from 15 4 1955 under the provisions of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953.
1109 On behalf of the claimants respondents it contended: (i) that the provisions of the 19S3 Act do not apply to the property in dispute which was under requisition in view of the second proviso to section 3 of the Act; (ii) that under section 6 of the 19S3 Act the claimants were entitled to retain an area of 75 acres of land with them and, therefore, they are entitled to recurring compensation with regard to that area even after 15th April,1955 (iii) that the requisitioned land contained minerals, the claimants had been excavating moo rams and coloured clay, they are, therefore.
entitled to retain the entire land with them under section 6 read with section 28 of the Act and (iv) that they should get interest at the rate of 6% per annum.
Allowing the Appeals partly.

in respect of the Sal trees and agricultural land etc. per annum with effect from 1 10 1942 to 15 4 1955.
The claimants are also entitled to interest on the aforesaid amount at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of requisition till the date of payment.

Agrarian reform was initiated in the State of West Bengal and with that end in view the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953 was g.acted to provide for the acqui sition of estates.
rights of intermediaries theresa and certain rights of raiyat and under raiyat in the land com prised, the estates.
Though section 4(1) of the Act conferred power on the State Government to issue notifications from time to time in respect of any district or part of a dis trict but the legislative intent is evidenced by sub section
(2) of section 4 which ordained that the State shall issue notifica tions so as to ensure that the entire area to which the Act applies shall be notified.
enabling the vesting of the interest of all intermediaries in the State on or before the first day of Baisakh of the Bengali year 1362 e.g. 15 4 1955.
The legislative mandate made it imperative to ensure that right.
title and interest of all intermediaries in the State of West Bengal shall be acquired by 15 4 1955.
[1116D Es G H; 1117A] 3.
In the instant case.
since the predecessor in inter est of the claimants had patni rights in the property.
he was an intermediary as defined by section 2(1) of the Act and his right, title and interest in the property vested in the State with effect from 15 4 1955 and thereafter he and his heirs could not claim any right or interest in the property except that they were entitled to receive compensation for the property so acquired in accordance with the provisions of the 1953 Act.
[1117E F] 1110 4.
Even though the claimants ceased to have any right or title in the requisitioned property after 15 4 1955 the High Court proceeded to award compensation to the claimants on the assumption that they continued to hold right.
title and interest in the property even after 15 41955.
this was apparently in utter disregard of the legislative mandate contained in section 4(2)of the 1953 Act.
[1117G H] 5.
Section 3 provides that the provision Of the Act shall have over riding effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law contract usage or custom to the contrary.
There are two exceptions to this which are contained in the two provisos.
The first proviso lays down that the provisions of the Act shall not apply to any land held by a Corporation.
while the second proviso lays down that the Act shall not affect any land possession Of which may have been taken by the State Government before issue of notification Under section 4 of the Act e.g. 5 4 1955, in fur therance of any proposal for acquiring the land irrespective of the fact whether any formal proceedings for such acquisi tion were started or not before the Commencement of the Act.
The second proviso is intended to protect the rights of those tenure holders whose land may have been the subject matter of acquisition proceedings under any law with a view to protect their right to get compensation.
Since the property in dispute was not under acquisition and the pos session of the same had been taken by the State in requisi tion proceedings, the second proviso has no application, [1118B D] 6.
Sections 4 to 6 of the Act confer right on an inter mediary to retain land to the extent specified in the var ious sub clauses of section 6(1) even though his right.
title and interest in the estate may have vested in the state.
An intermediary is entitled to retain land.
only if it fails within one of the various sub clauses of section 6(1) of the Act.
The claimants ' contention that they are entitled to retain 75 acres of land is rounded on the provisions of section 6(1)(d) which relates to agricultural land in the khas possession of intermediary.
under that provision as intermediary is enti tled to retain 25 acres of agricultural land which may be in his khas possession.
Since there are three claimants, they are claiming rights to retain 75 acres of land.
It is note worthy that section 6(1)(d) relates to agricultural land in khas possession of intermediary and not to any other land includ ing forest land.
There is no evidence on record to show that 75 acres of agricultural land was in the khas possession of the claimants on the date of vesting.
There is further no evidence that the claimants did not possess any other agri cultural land apart from that which is the subject matter of the requisition.
In the absence of any such evidence it is not possible to determine the question raised by the claim 1111 ants in the present proceedings.
If the .claimants were entitled to retain any part of the requisitioned land they should have taken proceedings before the appropriate author ities under the provisions of the 1953 Act.
This question cannot be raised for the first time before this Court.
Section 6(1)(k) merely provides that an intermediary is entitled to retain land which may be under requisition to the extent he is entitled to retain, under the various sub clauses of section 6(1).
Therefore, merely because the land is under requisition the claimants being intermediaries are not entitled to retain the same unless they are able to make out their case by leading cogent evidence to show that they were entitled to retain 75 acres of land or any other area under s, 6(1) of the Act.
[1118H; 1119A F] 7(i) Section 28 provides that so much of an area as was being used by an intermediary as mine immediately before the date of vesting shall with effect from such date be deemed to have been leased by the State Government to such interme diary on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the State Government.
This provision confers right on an intermediary to retain that much of area which may be com prised in a mine provided the mine was being directly worked by him immediately before the date of vesting.
Before an intermediary can claim this right he must first establish that he was directly working mine immediately before the date of vesting.
If this condition is not fulfilled the intermediary has no right to retain the land or to continue the mining operation.
If the mine was operated by a licensee or by some other person the intermediary would not be enti tled to the benefit of section 28 of the Act.
[1119G H; 1120A B] Tarkeshwar Sio Thakur Jiu vs Bar Dass Dey & Co. & Ors.
, referred to.
7(ii) In the instant case, there is no evidence on record to show that the claimants were carrying on any mining operations immediately before the date of vesting.
The only evidence which is available on record shows that in some area mooram had been excavated, But there is no evi dence to show as to whether the claimants had themselves excavated the Mooram directly or they had got the same excavated through some other agency.
Similary there is no evidence on record to show that the coloured clay which is a mineral was being prospected or excavated by the claimants themselves directly.
There is further no evidence to show that the claimants were carrying on mining operations di rectly immediately before the date of vesting.
In this view that claimants are not entitled to any benefit under section 28 of the Act.
[1120C E] 1112 8.
The finding of the High Court with regard to the award of Rs.2,00,000 as terminal compensation payable to the claimants is upheld [1120G] 9.
The High Court has recorded finding that 50 bighas of cultivable land was being used for cultivation and there was another 50 bighas of dang land where paddy crop was being cultivated.
In addition to that then was a tank having an area of 3.96 acres.
The land contained 22 mango trees also.
The High Court has determined total compensation for the aforesaid items at the rate of Rs.650 per annum.
There is no infirmity in the High Court 's Order.
Thus the claimants are entitled to recurring compensation of Rs.25,650 per acre in respect of Sal forest, agricultural land, tank and mango trees.
with effect from October, 1, 1942 to April 15. 1955.
[1121B D] 10(i) Recurring compensation i6 granted to make good the loss which the owner may suffer.
If the owner fails to prove recurring annual loss.
he could not he entitled to recurring compensation for the requisitioned property.
[112 1H; 1122A] 10(ii).
The High Court has awarded recurring annual compensation to the claimants for the underground deposits of mooram and coloured clay.
The claimants did not produce any evidence to show that moorams and coloured clay was available in the entire area or in a particular area of the requisitioned land.
No evidence was produced to indicate the quality of moorams and coloured clay or the actual loss which the claimants sustained.
In the absence of any such evidence, no recurring compensation could be granted to the claimants.
The High Court committed error in awarding annual recurring compensation of Rs.5,000 for the moorams and Rs.20,000 for the coloured clay.
[112 1D E; 1122D] 11.
Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case it is held that the claimants are entitled to interest on the amount of compensation payable to them at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of taking over possession 1 10 1942 till the date of payment.
