The petitioner 's bus driven by a driver hit an over hanging high tension wire resulting in the death of some passengers and loss of limb to several others.
The driver was acquitted on the ground that the tragedy was an act of God.
The Accidents Tribunal held that despite the screams of the passenger about the dangerous over hanging wire ahead the rash driver sped towards the spot which resulted in the accident.
The High Court affirmed the finding of the Tribunal that the accident had taken place due to rashness and negligence of the driver and consequently the petitioner was vicariously liable to pay compensation to the claimant.
Dismissing the petition, ^ HELD: 1.
The plea that the criminal case had ended in acquittal and that therefore the civil suit must follow suit was rightly rejected by the Tribunal and the High Court.
[102 E] 2.
The requirement of culpable rashness under section 304A I.P.C. is more drastic than negligence sufficient under the law of tort to create liability.
[102 E] The Accident Tribunal must take special care to see that innocent victims do not suffer and drivers and owners do not escape liability merely because of some doubt here or some obscurity there.
Save in plain cases, culpability must be inferred from the circumstances where it is fairly reasonable.
The court should not succumb to niceties and technicalities.
