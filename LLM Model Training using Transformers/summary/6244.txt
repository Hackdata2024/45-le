This writ petition has been filed pleading for separate schools and hostels for the children of prostitutes.
On behalf of respondents, it was contended that since they are in fact unwanted children of prostitutes it is in the interest of such children and the society at large that they are segregated from their mothers and be allowed to mingle with others and become part of the society.
Setting up a Committee consisting of 4 Advocates and 3 Social Workers to look into the matter and directing listing of the matter on receipt of the Committee 's report, this Court.
HELD: 1.
Children of prostitutes should not be permitted to live in inferno and the undesirable surroundings of prostitute homes.
This is particularly so for young girls whose body and mind are likely to be abused with growing age for being admitted into the profession of their mothers.
While separate schools and hostels for prostitute children are not desirable, accommodation in hostels and other refor matory homes should be adequately made available to help segregation of these children from their mothers living in prostitute homes as soon as they are identified.
