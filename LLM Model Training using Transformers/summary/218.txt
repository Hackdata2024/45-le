Held, that the rule of English law that a civil servant cannot ' maintain a suit against the State or against the Crown for the 787 recovery of arrears of salary does not prevail in India and it has been negatived by the provisions of the statute law in India.
Section 240 of the Government of India Act, 1935, places restrictions and limitations on the exercise of the pleasure of the Crown and these restrictions must be given effect to.
They are imperative and mandatory.
Therefore whenever there is a breach of restrictions imposed by the statute ' by the Government or the Crown the matter is justiciable and the aggrieved party is entitled to suitable relief at the hands of the court.
Government servants are entitled to relief like any other person under the ordinary law, and that relief must be regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure.
