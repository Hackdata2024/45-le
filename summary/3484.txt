The Rent Control and Eviction officer Dehradun.
granted permission to the respondent landlady under section 3 of the U.P. (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act, to file a suit for eviction of the appellant tenant, on the ground that the accommodation was required for her personal residence.
The tenant filed a revision application under section 3(2) of the Act, purporting to be made to the Commissioner, Meerut Division but actually filed before the Additional District Magistrate who rejected it as time barred.
The appellant tenant 's further revision application, made under section 7F of the Act.
was rejected by the State Government, and then his petition under Article 226 was rejected by a Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court on two grounds: Firstly that neither the Act, nor the rules made thereunder had any provision enabling the Additional District Magistrate to receive the tenant 's application under section 3(2).
and secondly that the time spent in obtaining the certified copy of the District Magistrate order could not be excluded under section 12(2) of the .
The appellant 's special appeal was summarily rejected by a Division Bench of the High Court.
In appeal by special leave, the appellant contended before the Court that.
as a practice had grown up in Dehradun, that the Additional District Magistrate receives the revision applications made to the Commissioner, the requirements of section 3(2) should be deemed to have been sufficiently complied with.
Dismissing the appeal, the Court, ^ HELD: There is not even a rule on this subject made by the State Government.
A wrong practice cannot possibly modify what naturally follows from the language if s.3(2) of the Act, that the party must apply to the Commissioner directly and not through some other authority or official.
For that purpose proof of at least specific authorisation by the Commissioner, after the introduction of section 3(2), was required.
