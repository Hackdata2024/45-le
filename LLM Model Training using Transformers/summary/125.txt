Where a lease of a flat situated within the City of Bombay contained a term that the tenant shall not assign, sub let or re let the premises, without the previous consent of the landlord and the tenant, in contravention of this term sub let the flat, and the landlord instituted a suit against him and the sub tenant in the Court of Small Causes Bombay, for possession and compensation for use and occupation of the premises, and the sub lessee contended that the Court of Small Causes had no jurisdiction so far as he was concerned inasmuch as the suit was not one between a landlord and a tenant nor, one for rent within section 28 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging Rates Control Act, 1947: Hold, (i) that the suit was clearly one for possession and the claim for compensation wag merely an incidental claim; (ii) section 28 of the Act conferred jurisdiction on the Court of Small Causes not only to entertain and try any suit or proceeding between a landlord and tenant for recovery of rent or possession, but also "to deal with any claim or question arising out of this Act or 'any of its provisions" ' and section 28 was thus wide enough to cover the question raised as between the plaintiff and the sub lessee ; (iii) in any event, though the sub lessee was not a necessary party to the suit he was a proper party, and the joinder of such a party cannot alter the nature of the suit and make it any the less a suit between a landlord and tenant or take it out of section 28.
