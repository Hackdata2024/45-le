Though a female is personally disqualified from officiating as a Pujari for the Shastrically installed and consecrated idols in the temples, the usage of a Hindu female succeeding to a priestly office and getting the same erformed through a competent deputy has been well recognised and it is not contrary to textual Hindu Law nor opposed to public policy.
Subject to the proper and efficient discharge of the duties of the office being safeguarded by appropriate action when necessary, a Hindu female has a right to succeed to the hereditary priestly office of a Pujari and Panda held by her husband and to get the duties of the office performed by a substitute except in cases where usage to the contrary is pleaded and established.
Quaere: Whether and how far votive offerings can be appropriated by a Pujari for his emoluments if the temple is a public institution, (i.e., not a private family temple) and whether any usage in this behalf is valid.
Case law and the relevant texts reviewed.
Judgment of the High Court of Patna reversed.
