Held, that sections 21, 30(2), 31, 55, 56 and 63 to 69 of the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1951 (Madras Act XIX of 1951) are ultra vires articles 19(1)(f), 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India.
Section 76(1) of the Act is void as the provision relating to the payment of annual contribution contained in it is a tax and not a fee and so it was beyond the legislative competence of the Madras State Legislature to enact such a provision.
That on the facts of the present case the imposition under a. 76(1) of the Act, although it is a tax, does not come within the latter part of article 27 because the object of the contribution under the section is not the fostering or preservation of the Hindu religion or any denomination under it but the proper administration of religious trusts and institutions wherever they exist.
130 1006 The word " property " as used in article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution should be given a liberal and wide connotation and should be extended to all well recognized types of interest which have the insignia or characteristics of proprietary right.
The ingredients of both office and property, of duties and personal interest are blended together in the rights of a Mahant and the Mahant has the right to enjoy this property or beneficial interest so long as he is entitled to hold his office.
Therefore he is entitled to claim the protection of article 19(1)(f).
A tax is a compulsory exaction of money by public authority for public purposes enforceable by law and is not payment for services rendered.
It is not possible to formulate a definition of fee that can apply to all cases as there are various kinds of fees.
But a fee may generally be defined as a charge for a special service rendered to individuals by some governmental agency.
The amount of fee levied is supposed to be based on the expenses incurred by the Government in rendering the service, though in many cases such expenses are arbitrarily assessed.
The distinction between a tax and a fee lies primarily in the fact that a tax is levied as part of a common burden, while a fee is a payment for a special benefit or privilege.
