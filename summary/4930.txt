An order granting two stage carriage permits by the Regional Transport Authority was set aside in appeal on the ground that the RTA had not been properly constituted.
Thereafter, the Regional Transport Authority, on its proper constitution, did not issue a fresh Notification section 57 (2) of the inviting fresh applications but granted a stage carriage permit to the appellant on the basis of applications received in pursuance of the earlier Notification.
On appeal by the aggrieved applicants the Appellate Authority set aside the said order and instead granted the permit to respondent No. 4.
The appellant 's revision application before the State Government having been failed, he filed a writ petition in the High Court against the order of the State Government on the grounds, (i) that at the time when the earlier Notification was issued section 57(2), the delegation of power by the invalidly constituted Authority to its Secretary to issue such Notification would be invalid and therefore the further proceedings adopted for consideration of such applications and grant of permits pursuant to such consideration was invalid; and (ii) that on merits the Appellate Authority ought not to have interfered with the five marks that had been granted to the appellant by the Regional Transport Authority and reduced the same to three and further that the Appellate Authority ought not to have relied upon the only solitary adverse entry in the appellant 's record to reject his application while preferring that of respondent No. 4.
The High Court also dismissed the writ petition.
The appellant advanced the same contentions before the Supreme Court, Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: (1) The first contention is liable to be rejected on three grounds, namely, (i) It was not disputed that applications under section 57 (2) of the Act for the grant of stage carriage permits could be filed voluntarily and without any Notification being issued in that behalf.
If that be so, the question whether a fresh Notification inviting fresh applications by the properly constituted Regional 805 Transport Authority ought to have bean issued or not or whether the properly A constituted Regional 'transport Authority could proceed to act on the earlier Notification issued by the Secretary would be immaterial and of no consequence and the ultimate decision not to grant stage carriage permit to the appellant cannot be disturbed on this ground; (ii) The non issuance of a fresh Notification by the properly constituted Regional Transport Authority could, if at all, be made a ground of attack by those persons who were unable to make applications because of such non issuance and not by the appellant who had made an application in that behalf and who took his chance to obtain the permit on the basis of his application which was in fact considered by the Regional Transport Authority and thereafter by the Appellate Authority; and (iii) The initial order granting the permit to the appellant was passed by a properly constituted Regional Transport Authority and the appellate order was also passed by State Transport Appellate Tribunal which was the properly constituted Appellate Authority and both these authorities had passed their orders on a consideration of the entire material placed before each of them and after giving a full hearing to the appellant and as such no failure of justice had occassioned.
[807C F; H; 8U8A] (2) This Court will not be justified in interfering in the matter on merits, since the High Court has rightly taken the view, (i) that the second contention really pertained to the merits of the claim of the appellant to the stage carriage permit and it could not interfere with the finding of fact recorded against the appellant in that behalf in exercise of its extra ordinary jurisdiction under article 226 of the Constitution; and (ii) that the grounds on which the marks of the appellant were reduced and the reasons for ultimate rejection of the appellant 's application were justified.
