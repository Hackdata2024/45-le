The appellant was convicted under section 34 of the Mysore Excise Act and sentenced to three months R.I. and a fine of Rs. 100/ for being in possession of 48 bottles of liquor, recovered from the car being driven by him.
It was contended that the provisions of section 54 had not been complied with, and the search was made without jurisdiction.
Allowing the appeal, the Court, ^ HELD: 1.
The Inspector who searched the car of the appellant had not made any record of any ground on the basis of which he had a reasonable belief that an offence under the Act, was being committed, before proceeding to search the car, and thus the provisions of section 54 were not at all complied with, thereby rendering the entire search without jurisdiction and, as a logical corollary, vitiating the conviction.

Both, Sections 53 and 54 contain valuable safeguards for the liberty of the citizen in order to protect them from ill founded or frivolous prosecution or harassment.
