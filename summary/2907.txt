The Divisional Forest Officer Kamrup Division Assam invited tenders for the purchase of monopoly rights to quarry stone for the period July 1, 1963 to June 30, 1964.
The tender submitted by the respondent was accepted and for the minimum quantity of 1,25,000 c.ft. of stone allotted to the res pondent he was to pay Rs. 31,250/ On appeal being filed against the order accepting the tender the Government of Assam granted stay of the order.
When three months later the appeal was dismissed for non prosecution the respondent declined to accept settlement of the quarry.
Thereafter tenders had to be invited again and it was only on January 10, 1964 that a settlement was made for a minimum quantity of 5000 c.ft.
for the period from January 25, 1964 to June 30, 1964 for Rs. 10,000.
The Divisional Forest Officer then sought to recover the amount of Rs. 31,250/ for which the tender of the respondent was accepted as arrears of land revenue in the manner provided by section 75 of the Assam Forest Regulation VII of 1891.
The respondent moved a petition in the High Court for an order quashing the proceeding for recovery of the amount demanded.
The High Court allowed the petition.
holding that the amount claimed was not recoverable under the aforesaid Regulation.
The State of Assam appealed to this Court with certificate.
It was conceded that the amount was not 'recoverable under section 75 of the Regulation but reliance was placed on Rule 10 of the rules made under the Regulation, HELD The appeal must fail.
Rule 10 does not apply to recovery of the amount alleged to be due for failure to carry out the obligations of the tender by proceedings under the Assam Forest Regulation 1891.
It is again difficult to hold that 'stone ' is forest produce within the meaning of the Act.
In any event the Rule does not give rise to any liability to pay a sum of money.
It merely imposes a limitation upon the power of the officers of the Forest Department to grant leases in respect of certain forest produce.
The lease may not be granted except in accordance with the general or special order of the conservator who alone is empowered to authorise sale in respect of such a lease.
