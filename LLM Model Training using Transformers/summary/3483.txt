Under Rule 2046 (b) of Railway Establishment Code a Ministerial Railway servant was entitled to the higher age of retirement at 60 years (i) if he had entered service on or before 31st March 1938 and (ii) if he held on 31st March 1938 either a lien or a suspended lien on a permanent post under Rule 2008(a) or a provisional lien on a permanent post under Rule 2008(d) without interruption until he was confirmed in that post.
The respondent had been appointed a temporary clerk on 10th December 1936 and was confirmed in that post on 1st September 1938.
When he was retired on attaining the age of 58, he challenged the orders claiming benefit of Rule 2046(b).
The High Court allowed the writ petition holding that since he was confirmed on 1st September 1938 he would be deemed to have been permanently appointed since 10th December 1936.
Allowing the appeal by special leave the court, ^ HELD: (1) Rule 2046(b) clearly lays down that not only the first but one of the two alternatives of the second set of conditions must also be fulfilled by the Government servant "on that date" i.e. 31st March 1938.
The specified requirement of the rule could not be overridden by some deemed retrospective benefit alleged to accrue from a confirmation subsequent to 31st March 1938.
