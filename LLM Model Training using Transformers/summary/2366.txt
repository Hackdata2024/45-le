The appellant, a manufacturer of fireworks was convicted under section 5 (3) of the Indian as he had allowed minors to work in the manufacture of fireworks thus contravening r. 16 of the Explosives Rules.
HELD: Clause (a) of section 5(3) deals with a person who imports or manufactures in contravention of the Rules; el.
(b) deals with a person who possesses, uses, sells or transports any explosive in contravention of the Rules; and el.
(c) deals with the contravention of the Rules in other cases.
If there is a breach of a rule, it has to be ascertained in each case whether the rule or part of it relates to activities mentioned in el.
(a) of section 5(3) or el.
(b) of section 5(3).
If it does not relate to any of the activities mentioned in el.
(a) or cl(3)(b) of section 5(3) the breach of the rule would fall under cl.
(c) of section 5(3) .
[430 A B; 431 H] In this case, though it was established that the minors were employed in or allowed to enter the premises, it was not proved that the minors were employed in any of the activities mentioned in el.
(a) or el.
(b) of section 5(3).
Nor it has been proved that any manufacture of fireworks was done on that day.
So the contravention of r. 16 on the facts found, could only be punishable under el.
(e) of section 5(3).
