The appellant was caught while he was himself transporting opium.
He was convicted under section 9(a) of the Opium Act for posession " of opium and under section 9(b) of the Act for " transport of opium and was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months under each count, the sentences to run consecutively.
The appellant contended that " transport " included " possession " and so the double punishment for possession and transport was not warranted by law : Held, that possession of opium and transport of opium are two separate offences and the appellant could be convicted for 1163 both the offences.
Transport of opium may, in certain cases, include the element of possession, and in other cases, it may not.
A person transporting opium through other agencies may not be in possession of it at the time it was transported.
But a person transporting opium himself would be in possession of it and would be guilty of both offences.
The sentence passed upon the appellant did not contravene the provisions of section 71 of the Indian Penal Code.

Though separate sentences were passed against the appellant unders .9(a)and(b),the sum total of these sentences did not exceed one year 's imprisonment the maximum provided for any of these offences.
