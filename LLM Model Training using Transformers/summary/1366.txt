In 1947 S conveyed by a sale deed to M an undivided half share of Land in his village.
On the same day S executed a Kabulayat for 5 years in respect of the same land for cultivation.
In 1951 the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1951, came into force and the Compensation Officer started enquiry about assessment of compensation.
M claimed to retain possession of the half share in all the fallow lands in the village which had been leased by him for cultivation to S on the plea that these lands were 'home farm '.
The claim 711 was rejected by the Compensation Officer and confirmed by the Additional Settlement Commissioner.
The High Court of Nagpur quashed the order.
In appeal to the Supreme the Additional Settlement Commissioner contended that in respect of an undivided interest in the land, the superior holder is not entitled to the benefit of section 4(2) of the Act because it is not a 'holding ', alternatively, that the land which was, at the date of vesting, lying fallow otherwise than in accordance with the usual agricultural practice could never be regarded as 'home farm '.
^ Held, that a part of a holding or an undivided interest in a " holding" in Berar may also be 'home farm ' land if it otherwise fulfils the requirement of cl.
(i), (ii) or (iii) of sub cl.
(3) of section 2(g) of the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1951.
The land having been granted in lease for cultivation it is by virtue of section 4(2) of the Act to be retained in the possession of the proprietor.
Grant of a lease for cultivation evidences an intention on the part of the proprietor that the land is to be converted to agricultural purposes, and default on the part of the lessee to cultivate the land will not deprive the lessor proprietor of the benefit granted to him by the statute.
