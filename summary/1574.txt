Seven persons including the appellants were convicted for murder.
Relying upon the dying declaration 'of one G, the High Court acquitted five of the accused but convicted the appellants.
G had been injured during the occurrence and had been taken to the hospital where his dying declaration was recorded.
He left the hospital and died 20 days later.
Before any postmortem examination could be held, his body was cremated.
The appellants contended that the dying declaration was inadmissible and that they were entitled to an acquittal.
Held, that the dying declaration was inadmissible in evidence.
There was no evidence on the record as to what caused the death of G.
The mere fact that G had received two gun shot injuries during the occurrence which in the opinion of the doctor were dangerous to life was not sufficient for holding that G must have died on account of these injuries.
Under section 32 (1) of the Evidence Act the Statement of a person who has died is relevant only when it relates to the cause of his death or to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death.
When it was not established that G had died as a result of the injuries received at the incident, his statement did not relate to the cause of his death or to the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death and did not fall within section 32 (1).
