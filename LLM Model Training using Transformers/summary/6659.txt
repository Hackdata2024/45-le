This appeal has been filed against the judgment of the Delhi High Court whereby the High Court gave the widow landlady the benefit of section 14 D of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 and accordingly granted her the Possession of the premises in question.
Before this Court it was inter alia contended on behalf of the appellant that the relief under section 14 D was available only to a landlady who had become a Widow after the premises were let out either by herself or her husband.
it was further contended that if the benefit given by section 14 D was allowed to be availed by all widows, they may make a business of it.
Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: (1) The legislature w anted to give a special privilege to the landlady who is a widow notwithstanding whether the Premises were let out before or after she became widow.
Such conferment of special benefit on a widow landlady is permissible even under the provisions of Article 15(3) of the Constitution which is an express exception to the provisions of sub clauses (1) and (2) of that Article.
A widow is undoubtedly a vulnerable person in our society and requires special protection.
[383H 384B] (2) Section 14 D can be availed of by the widow only once.
That is a sufficient guarantee against the abuse of the privilege granted by the section.
Secondly, she has to prove her bona fide need for the occupation of the Premises in question for her own residence like any other landlord.
Thirdly, the provisions of section 19 of the Delhi Rent Control Act come to play in her case also, when the order for possession on the ground of bona fide requirement for occupation as residence is made in her favour.
