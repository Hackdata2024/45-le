The detenue was served with the order of detention and the grounds in English.
He did not know English and asked for a translation of these in Hindi.
This request was refused on the grounds that the order and the grounds had been orally translated to him at the time they were served upon him and that English still being the official language communication of the order and grounds in English was in accordance with the law and the Constitution.
^ Held, that the provisions of article 22(5) of the Constitution were not complied with and the detention was illegal.
Article 22(5) required that the grounds should be communicated to the detenue as soon as may be and that he should be afforded the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.
Communication in this context meant bringing home to the detenue effective knowledge of the facts and grounds on which the order was based.
To a person who was not conversant with the English language, in order to satisfy the requirement of the Constitution, the detenue must be given the grounds in a language which he can understand and in a script which he can read, if he is a literate person.
Mere oral translation at the time of service was not enough.
