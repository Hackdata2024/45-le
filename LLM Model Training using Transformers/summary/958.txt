The appellant, after due notice to the respondent, had filed a suit for fixation of rent under the provisions of the Accommodation Control Ordinance Madhya Bharat.
In the meantime the Accommodation Control Act (M. P. 15 of 1950) came into force and the plaint filed by the appellant was returned.
The appellant without serving a second notice filed a fresh suit under the Act,, which was decreed.
The respondent contended that a suit could not be instituted under the Act without a fresh notice, because of section 7(2) of the Act.
Held, that section 7(2) of the Accommodation Control Act (M. P. 15 of 1950) contemplates that a notice should be given but there are no words in the section which made it obligatory that the notice should be issued in terms as under the Act and be given after the Act came into force.
In the instant case it cannot be said that the notice which was given by the appellant was not a proper notice.
