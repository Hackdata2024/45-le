The appellant made a complaint against the respondent, an Assistant Commissioner of Police for having committed an offence under section 348, Indian Penal Code, alleging that on the arrest of the appellant under section 1208/420 Indian Penal Code, the respondent had refused to grant him bail until a certain sum was paid or acknowledged in writing to be paid to the complainant.
The Chief Presidency Magistrate issued process.
On revision, the High Court quashed the process holding that sanction of the State Government under section 197 Code of Criminal Procedure ought to have been obtained.
On appeal by special leave, it was contended that the High Court in quashing the process had proceeded to decide on the merits of the case even though there was no material before it and therefore its judgment could not stand.
Held: (i) For considering whether section 197 Code of Criminal Procedure would apply the Court must confine itself to the allegations made in the complaint.
But that does not mean that it need not look beyond the form in which the allegations have been made and is incompetent to ascertain for itself their substance.
(ii) The sanction of the appropriate authority for the respondent 's prosecution was necessary under section 197 Code of Criminal Procedure.
Whether a person charged with an offence should or should not be released on bail was a matter within the discretion of the respondent and if while exercising a discretion he acted illegally by saying that bail would not be granted unless the appellant did something which the appellant was not bound to do, the respondent cannot be said to have acted otherwise than in his capacity as a public servant.
