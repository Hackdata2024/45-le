The respondent assessee built up a factory for the manufacture of paper and paper boards, which started production on 7.5.1964.
The respondent claimed that the duty in respect of the paper boards manufactured in the factory during the period 7.5.1964 to June 1966 was payable at the concessional rates allowed by the Government of India notification dated 1st March, 1964.
The claim was however rejected by the Revenue on the ground that the factory had not come into existence on or before the 9th day of November, 1963 as stipulated in clause (a) of Proviso (3) of the said notification.
The respondent 's writ application before the High Court was allowed by the Single Judge and the appellant 's Letters Patent appeal was dismissed in limine.
The High Court has accepted the respondent 's contention that the date '9th of November, 1963 ' mentioned in the notification was arbitrary.
On behalf of the Revenue it was contended that the date (9.11.1963) was selected because an earlier notification bearing No. 110 had required applications to be made on or after 9.11.1963.
It was further contended that a statutory provision had necessarily to be arbitrary in the choice of date and it could not be challenged on that ground.
On behalf of the respondent it was contended that the said date did not have any significance whatsoever and did not bear any rational relationship to the object sought to be achieved by the notification.
PG NO 1051 PG NO 1052 Dismissing the appeal, it was HELD: 1.
A rule which makes a difference between past and present cannot be condemned as arbitrary and whimsical.
[1056D] 2.
In cases where choice of the date is not material for the object to be achieved.
the provisions are generally made prospective in operation.
[1056D] 3.
The Revenue has not been able to produce notification No. l 10.
Unless the nature and contents of notification No. 110 and its relevance with reference to the present notification are indicated, it is futile to try to defend of the choice of the date in clause (a) on its basis.
[1055A;1056E] 4.
In the present case, the benefit of concessional rate was bestowed upon the entire group of assesses referred therein and by clause (a) of Proviso (3) the group was divided into two classes without adopting any differentia having a rational relation to the object of the Notification.
[1057F] 5.
Clause (a) of the Proviso (3) of the Notification was ultra vires and the benefit allowed by the Notification would be available to the entire group including the respondent.
