This was an appeal against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, which in accordance with the well settled principle laid down by this Court as also the High Court, held that in the absence of any statutory rule or executive memorandum or order laying down the rule for determination of seniority in a grade, the normal rule applicable would be to determine the seniority on the basis of length of service.
Disposing of the Appeal, the Court, HELD: Counsel for the appellant contended that there were two rules in the case being Rules 12 (b) and 12 (c) of the M.P. Civil Services (General Conditions of Services) Rules, 1961, which governed the case.
In the proper perspective, these two rules did not apply in this case.
The High Court was right in the view it took in the matter.
This Court was unable to sustain the reasoning and view of the Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Umeshnarayan Mishra & ors.
vs The State of M.P. & Ors.
in Civil Misc.
Petition No. 181 of 1983.
[74C; 75F] In view of the short length of service of the appellant, if the appellant made a representation, the respondent would consider the same in the light of the principles of law and equity.
