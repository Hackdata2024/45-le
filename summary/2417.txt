The appellant was the sole proprietor of a business carried on by him under the name and style of M/s. Raghunath Dass Mulkhraj.
He sent a notice under section 80 C.P.C. on behalf of 'M/s. Raghunath Dass Mulkhraj to the General Manager East Indian Railway Calcutta in connection with a claim for compensation for lost goods.
The notice was signed by him as proprietor 'for M/s. Raghunath Dass Mulkhraj '.
When he subsequently filed a suit against the Railway its maintainability was challenged on the ground that the notice under section 80 was invalid, as there was no identity between the person who sent the notice and the person who filed the suit.
The suit was decreed by the trial Court but the plea that the notice was invalid was accepted by the High Court.
The appellant with certificate, came to this Court.
HELD: The object of the notice contemplated by section 80 is to give to the concerned Governments and public officers opportunity to reconsider the legal position and to make amends or settle the claim, if so advised without litigation so that public time and money may not be wasted.
The provisions in section 80 Civil Procedure Code are not intended to be used as boobytraps against ignorant and illiterate persons.
[454 B C] In the present case although the notice has been sent under the appellant 's trade name he had clearly indicated that he 'signed it as the proprietor of the business.
The notice had to be read as a whole and in a manner not divorced from common sense.
So read the notice could not have given the Union of India the impression that it was issued on behalf of a partnership concern.
The High Court had wrongly held that the notice was invalid.
