The appellant purchased groundnuts out of which it manu factured groundnut oil ; it also refined the oil and hydrogenated it converting it into Vanaspati.
It sold the oil in all the three states.
Under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, and the Turnover and Assessment Rules, for determining the taxable turnover the appellant was entitled to deduct the purchase price of the groundnuts from the proceeds of the sale of all groundnut oil.
The High Court held that the appellant was entitled to the deduction in respect of the sales of unrefined and refined groundnut oil but not in respect of the sales of hydrogenated oil on the ground that Vanaspati was not " groundnut oil " but a product of groundnut oil.
Held, that the appellant was entitled to the deduction in respect of the sales of hydrogenated groundnut oil also.
The hydrogenated groundnut oil continued to be " groundnut oil " notwithstanding the processing which was merely for the purpose of rendering the oil more stable.
To be groundnut oil two conditions had to be satisfied it must be from groundnut and it must be " oil ".
The hydrogenated oil was from groundnut and in its essential nature it remained an oil.
It continued to be used for the same purposes as groundnut oil which had not undergone the process.
A liquid state was not an essential characteristic of a vegetable oil ; the mere fact that hydrogenation made it semisolid did not alter its character as an oil.
