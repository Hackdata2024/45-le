During the accounting order relevant to assessment year 1965 66, the Respondent assessee paid to its foreign technical director a total remuneration of Rs. 66,000 including a sum of Rs. 28,576 paid by way of perquisites.
The Income tax Officer allowed only a sum of Rs. 13,200 by way of perquisites and disallowed the balance of Rs. 15,376 in view of Section 40(c)(iii) of the Income tax Act, 1961.
On an appeal by the assessee, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that since the salary of the foreign technical director was exempt under S.10(6)(vii), the provision contained in Sec.40(c)(iii) was not applicable.
Revenue preferred an appeal and the Tribunal held that S.40(c)(iii) was applicable.
At the instance of the Assessee, Tribunal referred the question to the High Court.
Since the High Court answered the question in favour of the assessee, Revenue preferred the present appeal.
Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: Under section 10(6)(vii) of the Income tax Act, 1961 the remuneration due to any technician, who was not a resident in any of the four financial years immediately preceding the financial year in which he arrived in India, chargeable under the head 'salaries ', for services rendered as a technician, was exempt.
Thus in the instant case, the salary paid to the foreign technical director was admittedly exempt under Section 10(6)(vii) of the Income tax Act, 1961.
In other words, it was nil for the purposes of the Act.
If so, the second proviso to sub clause (iii) of S.40(c) 994 is attracted, inasmuch as 'nil ' income, under the head 'salaries" is less than Rupees seven thousand five hundred.
By virtue of the said proviso, the main provision in sub clause (iii) goes out of picture.
The High Court reasoned that if income of one rupee is less than Rs. 7,500, there is no reason for saying that 'nil ' income is not an income less than Rs. 7,500.
The High Court was right in taking the view that since the income exempted under Section 10 is not liable to be included in the total income, such exempted salary income should be treated as 'nil ' income for the purposes of Section 40(c)(iii) of the Act.
