The Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking disconnected the supply of electricity to the respondent company during the pendency of the suit for a prohibitory injunction with out serving notice on the consumer.
The trial court dis missed the amended suit for mandatory injunction to restore the supply.
The First Appellate Court decreed the suit on the sole ground of non service of notice as required under condition No. 36 in regard to supply of electricity by the appellant.
It did not go into the allegation of theft of electricity by the plaintiff.
The High Court dismissed the appeal.
Dismissing the appeal by special leave, this Court, HELD: 1.
The licensee undertaking is performing a public duty and is governed by a special statute.
The law also contemplates service of a notice before disconnection of supply of electricity.
The appellant cannot also be allowed to go back upon its words and refuse the consumer the bene fit of notice as contemplated by the agreement.
The suit was, therefore, rightly decreed by the First Appellate Court.
[735B C, A B] 2.
The plaintiff is seriously denying the allegation of theft.
It is not possible to assume the accusation as cor rect without a full fledged trial on this issue.
The courts below have not examined the case on merits.
The question whether the allegations are true or not has to be examined and decided in an appropriate proceeding.
The appellant will not, therefore, be prejudiced in its claim by dismissal of the appeal.
