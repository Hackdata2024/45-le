These two appeals Civil Appeal No. 3446 of 1987 and Civil Appeal No. 3447 of 1987 were filed in this Court against the judgment of the High Court in the Writ Petition No. 6789 of 1982.
Ratan Prakash Mangal and Kuldip Singh, respondents Nos. 1 and 2 in the Civil Appeal No. 3446 of 1987 and the appellants in Civil Appeal No. 3447 of 1987, had filed the said writ petition challenging a notification dated 20th May, 1982, issued under section 4(1) read with section 17(4) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (the Act) and also the consequential notification dated 21st May, 1982, issued under section 6 of the Act with regard to a plot No. 289.
The notification under section 4(1) of the Act was quashed in part in so far as it invoked Section 17(4) of the Act, and the notification under section 6 was quashed as a whole with regard to the said plotNo.
The Civil Appeal No. 3446 of 1987 was preferred by Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti, Muzaffar Nagar for which the said plot had been acquired, for setting aside the judgment of the High Court.
Civil Appeal No. 3447 of 1987 was preferred by Ratan Prakash Mangal and Kuldip Singh afore mentioned hereinafter referred to as respondents Nos. 1 & 2 asserting that the notification under section 4(1) should have been quashed by the High Court in its entirety and not only in so far it invoked section 17(4) of the Act.
Initially, a Notification dated 20th March, 1975 was issued under section 4(1) of the Act for acquiring land, including the plot No. 289, for construction of a market yard for the appellant Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti.
Later, this Notification was superseded by another Notification dated 30th August, 1975 issued under section 4(1) with regard to land which did not include the said plot.
Subsequently, another Notification dated 26th October, 1978, was issued under section 4(1) read with Section 17(4) of the Act with regard to land, including the plot abovementioned.
The Notification dated 26th October, 1978 was followed by 183 a Notification dated 27th October, under section 6.
Prior to the issue of these Notifications, respondents Nos. 1 and 2 had purchased the said plot No. 289.
The said respondents Nos. 1 and 2 had challenged the Notifications dated 26th October, 1978 and 27th October, 1978 by a writ petition in the High Court.
The High Court had quashed the two Notifications in so far as Plot No. 289 was concerned.
This Judgment of the High Court had been challenged by Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti before this Court in Civil Appeal No. 2970 of 1979.
This Court had held that even though the quashing of the Notification under Section 6 had been justified, the High Court had not been right in quashing the Notification under section 4(1) in its entirety, and had set aside the Judgment of the High Court in so far as it had quashed the Notification under section 4(1) in its entirety, while maintaining the rest of the Judgment with a direction regarding inquiry under Section 5A into the objections of the respondents Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed acquisition etc.
In pursuance of the said direction, inquiry under section 5A had been made and the Land Acquisition Officer had submitted a report on 20th January, 1981, after about 15 months of the direction above said of this Court, to the effect that the Plot No. 289 might be exempted from acquisition.
The Government did not agree with the said report and issued the Notifications impugned in present appeals.
Allowing Civil Appeal No. 3446 of 1987, and dismissing Civil Appeal No. 3447 of 1987, the Court, ^ HELD: There was no doubt with regard to the legal position that the Report dated 20th January, 1981 of the Land Acquisition Officer was not binding on the State Government and it was still open to it to continue the proceedings for the acquisition of the Plot No. 289 notwithstanding the said report.
The Government had its reason why in place of issuing a Notification under section 6(1) of the Act in continuation of the Notification dated 26th October, 1978 under section 4(1), fresh notifications under section 4 and 6 had to be issued as also the reason for the delay in issuing the fresh Notifications, as was apparent from the record.
As regards the submission that section 17(4) of the Act had been erroneously invoked in fresh Notification under section 4(1) dated 20th May, 1982 also and that inquiry under Section 5A had again to be made before issuing this Notification, it was enough to point out that once an inquiry under the said section had already been made and the parties had been given full opportunity to substantiate their case in the enquiry and the State Government had not been inclined to agree with the 184 report of the Land Acquisition Officer submitted in pursuance of that inquiry, it would have been a futile exercise to repeat the whole performance again.
After the issue of the earlier Notification dated 26th October, 1978, a period of nearly 3 1/2 years had expired when the fresh Notification dated 20th May, 1982 above said was issued and apparently the necessity to acquire the plot No. 289 during this period became more acute due to this delay.
Further, as stated in the said Notification itself, the urgency had become more imminent on account of the direction issued by this Court on 2nd March, 1982 in Writ Petition No. 1318 of 1982 filed by the traders in gur, khandseri and foodgrains, Muzaffar Nagar, challenging the Notification under Section 7(2)(b) of the U.P. Act No. 25 of 1964.
Consequently, it was diffcult to hold that the opinion of the State Government that it was a fit case to invoke section 17(4) of the Act was invalid on the ground that there was no basis or material in support of the opinion.
On the facts of the case, it was not possible to hold that the Notification dated 20th May, 1982 had been issued by the State Government in colourable exercise of its power.
[194A F] The Notification dated 20th May, 1982 and 21st May, 1982 had not been challenged by respondents Nos. 1 and 2 on the basis of mala fides of any particular officer of the State Government.
What was urged was that it was a case of legal mala fides inasmuch as in issuing the said fresh Notification dated 20th May, 1982, an attempt had been made by the State Government to circumvent the direction of this Court issued in the Civil Appeal No. 2970 of 1979 to make inquiry under Section 5A of the Act and to proceed thereafter in accordance with law, the State Government did make an inquiry under Section 5A of the Act in pursuance of the direction of this Court after giving full opportunity to the concerned parties to substantiate their case.
It was difficult to agree with the submission of respondents 1 and 2 that the government attempted to circumvent the direction of this Court.
A case of legal mala fide was not made out.
[194G H; 195B] The Government all through was of the opinion that Plot No. 289 did not deserve to be released from acquisition.
Also, this plea lost significance and became almost of academic value inasmuch as the State Government had not issued a notification under section 6(1) of the Act in continuation of the Notification dated 26th October, 1978 under Section 4(1).
After the issue of the fresh Notification what was really to be seen was whether there was justification for invoking section 17(4) of Act or not.
There was such a justification.
There had been a material change in the circumstances after the report of the Land Acquisition 185 Officer dated 20th January, 1981, to justify Section 17(4) of the Act being invoked and to dispense with a further inquiry under section 5A of the Act.
[196D E; 198C] The submission of the respondents 1 and 2 about the lack of application of mind before issuing the Notification dated 20th May, 1982 with regard to plot No. 289 had no substance, as indicated by the original record produced by counsel for the State Government.
The effect of issuing a fresh Notification under Section 4(1) and the delay in issuing it had benefited the respondents 1 and 2 inasmuch as now they would be entitled to compensation not on the basis of market value of plot No. 289 as on 26.10.78 when the earlier Notification under Section 4(1) was issued but as on 20th May, 1982 when the fresh Notification under the said section was issued.
[200G H; 201A] Civil Appeal No. 3446 of 1987 was allowed and the judgment of the High Court in the Writ Petition No. 6789 of 1982 was set aside, and as a consequence, Civil Appeal No. 3447 of 1987 was dismissed.
