The respondent was posted as officer incharge of a police station when complaints were received by the District Magis trate that the respondent was receiving bribes.
The District Magistrate got an enquiry made by the Sub Divisional Magistrate and forwarded the report toghether with his own endorsement to the Superintendent of Police.
The respondent was forced to go on 2 months leave and was reverted to his substantive post of Head Constable, but later he was promoted to the rank of officiating Sub Inspector and posted at another police station.
Meanwhile on further complaints an investigation was made and it was reported that the respondent was a habitual bribe taker.
He was charged under section 7 Police Act for 9 charges of bribery and after departmental trial was dismissed by the Superintendent of Police.
He filed a Writ Petition before the High court challenging the order of dismissal inter alia on the ground that the offences charged being cognizable offences the Superintendent of Police had no jurisdiction to hold the departmental trial without first complying with the provisions of para.
486(1) of the U. P. Police Regulations.
The High Court accepted this contention and quashed the order of dismissal.
673 Held (per Sarkar, Subba Rao and Mudholkar, JJ.) that the subject matter of the magisterial enquiry and of the depart mental trial was substantially the same and that the depart 'I mental trial was validly held.
The fact that there was an interregnum between the magisterial enquiry and the departmental trial did not affect the question.
Paragraph 486 did not apply to a case where a magisterial enquiry was ordered and a police officer could be departmentally tried under section 7 Police Act after such magisterial enquiry.
Per Gajendragadkar and Wanchoo, JJ.
The provisions of para.
486 were merely directory and even if there was non compliance therewith the order of dismissal was not invalidated.
