The Amritsar Improvement Trust framed a scheme under section 3 of the Punjab Development and Damaged Areas Act, 1951, which empowered it to frame a scheme for the development of a damaged area, It passed a resolution to acquire certain property of the appellant for widening a road under the scheme.
The appellant contended that the scheme was without jurisdiction as the area was not a "damaged area" within section 2 (d) of the Act which contemplated only two classes of areas, i. e. (i) areas which may, by notification, under the Act be declared by the Government to be "damaged areas", and (ii) areas already notified under the Punjab Damaged Areas Act, 1949.
The respondents contended that a notification 243 issued under the Punjab Damaged Areas Act, 1947, which declared the entire walled City of Amritsar as a "damaged area" should be deemed to be a declaration" under the 1949 Act because of the operation of section 22 of the Punjab General Clauses Act and was sufficient to sustain the scheme and that the scheme could not be challenged as it had been notified by the State Government and under section 5 (4) of the Act the publication was conclusive evidence that the scheme had been duly framed and sanctioned.
Held, that the scheme was without jurisdiction and that the proceedings for the acquisition of the appellant 's property were illegal.
Admittedly the area had not been declared a "damaged area either under the 1951 Act or under the 1949 Act.
The declaration under the 1947 Act was of no avail, firstly, because there was no basis for the argument that it would be "deemed to be a declaration" under the Act of 1949 and secondly even if it were so deemed the same was not within the definition of damaged area" in the Act of 1951.
The appellant was not precluded by section 5 (4) from challenging the scheme and the acquisition ; since the collusiveness postulated by section 5 (4) was only in respect of the formalities prescribed by sections 3,4 and 5 and did not touch a case where there was complete lack of jurisdiction in the authorities to frame a scheme.
