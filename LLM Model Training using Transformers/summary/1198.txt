Sub section (2A) of section 34 of the Bombay Tenancy and Agri cultural Lands Act, 1948, as amended by the Amending Act of 1952, applied from the date when the tenancy stood terminated on expiry of the notice of ejectment served on the tenant by the landlord under section 34(1) of the Act and not from the date of the notice.
The Amending Act could not be said to divest the landlord of any vested right since he could have none till the period of notice terminated and the tenancy came to an end.
Consequently, where the landlord gave notice of ejectment under section 34(1) of the Act, but the Amending Act came into force before the period of notice expired the landlord could be entitled to possession only after satisfying the provisions of that subsection.
