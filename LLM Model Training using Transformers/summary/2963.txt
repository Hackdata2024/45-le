The respondent was a citizen of India at the commencement of the Constitution in 1950.
He entered India on April 1, 1955, with a Pakistani passport dated March 15, 1955, and overstayed in India beyond the permitted period.
He was arrested in 1963 and was charged with an offence under section 14 of the Foreigners Act, and convicted.
While the criminal proceedings were pending, the Central Government, under section 9(2) of the , read with r. 30 of Citizenship Rules, 1956, determined on November 5, 1964, that the respondent had acquired citizenship of Pakistan after January 26, 1950, and before March 15, 1955.
The High Court set aside the conviction.
On appeal to this Court, HELD: (1) The respondent was not a 'foreigner ' within the meaning of the Foreigners Act before its amendment in 1957.
[500 G H] (2) Having been a citizen of India at the commencement of the Constitution and not being a foreigner under the Foreigners Act at the date of his entry, till the Central Government determined the question of the respondent having acquired Pakistan nationality and thereby lost Indian nationality, he could not be treated as a foreigner and no penal action could be taken against him.
[497 G; 501 ' A B] (3) The order of the Central Government dated November 5, 1964 determining that the respondent was a Pakistani was final, but the determination by the Central Government could not have the effect of retrospectively rendering his stay in India before that date a penal offence.
It was not as if he was given any directions after November 5, 1964, which were disobeyed by him entailing his prosecution.
