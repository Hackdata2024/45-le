M, a Hindu belonging to the Brahmin community in the Amritsar District of Punjab, instituted a suit for the possession of a half share in the property left by his natural paternal grandfather.
His father had predeceased him, but another son of his grandfather was alive.
He had been adopted away in a different family but he claimed that according to the custom of his community in the district he was entitled to get his share in the estate of his natural grandfather.
The based his claim on the principle of representation that he, stepped into the shoes of his natural father.
Held, that under section 5 of the , the law applicable to Hindus in Punjab in respect of questions regarding succession and other matters referred to in that section, is Hindu law in the first instance, but where a custom different from Hindu law is proved then the rights of the parties would be governed by that custom; and whosoever asserts a custom at variance with Hindu law has to prove it, though the quantum of proof required in support of the custom which is general and well recognised may be small while in other cases of what are called special customs the quantum may be larger.
Held, further, that in the Amritsar district of Punjab amongst Brahmins and Khatri s, a son given away in adoption can succeed to the property of his natural father if there is no other son of the natural father, but if there is another son he cannot succeed.
Held, also, that in the present case neither under Hindu law nor under the customary law of Punjab could M succeed to the property of his natural grandfather.
