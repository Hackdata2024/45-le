In the Application under Article 32 of the Constitution by 55 persons claiming the benefit of the scheme of pension for Freedom Fighters, the petitioners contended that they had joined the Arya Samaj movement in the late 1930s within the erstwhile Nizam 's State of Hyderabad and were convicted under different provisions of the criminal law and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment; that the Arya Samaj move ment had been equated with the freedom struggle and the benefit of the pension scheme was admissible to those who had participated in the movement.
The respondents while not disputing the assertion of the petitioners that the Union of India has accepted the Arya Samaj movement to be a part of the freedom struggle, has disputed the entitlement of pension in the case of most of the petitioners.
Allowing the petition, this Court, HELD: 1.
Freedom Fighters ' Pension Scheme of 1972 which was renamed as "Swatantrata Sainik Samman Pension Scheme 1980" indicates: "A person who has suffered a minimum im prisonment for six months in the mainland jails before independence in the struggle for independence is eligible to be admitted to the benefits of the pension.
" Each of the petitioners had been convicted and was ordered to suffer imprisonment of more than six months.
While they were under going sentence, without their praying for any 'emission, a general amnesty was declared by the then Nizam on his birth day and the sentence was reduced and the petitioners were set free.
[118 E F,D] 2.
In the facts of the case it would be appropriate to hold that each of the petitioners satisfied the condition for earning the benefit of pension and the fact that while undergoing sentence which was for a period beyond 117 six months remission had been granted and they were let off earlier would not take away their right to earn pension.
