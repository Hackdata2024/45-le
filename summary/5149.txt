A State Roadways bus met with an accident resulting in the death of three persons.
On an application being filed on behalf of one of the persons, the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal awarded a compensation of Rs.93,600 to the widow and the minor children of the deceased, with interest at 6 per cent per annum.
The claimants as well as the State appealed to the High Court, which dismissed the claimants ' appeal, and partly allowed the appeal by the State.
While holding that the accident was caused by the rash and negligent act of the driver of the bus, the High Court reduced the compensation to Rs.79,200 but confirmed the award of interest made by the Tribunal.
In the special leave petition it was contended for the petitioners claimants that they were entitled to an even greater amount of compensation on account of the different sources of income arising to the deceased.
Disposing of the special leave pention, the Court, ^ HELD: The High Court erred in reducing the quantum of compensation awarded by the Tribunal.
There was sufficient material on the record to justify the quantification determined by the Tribunal and there was no reason why the amount should have been reduced.
The amount of compensation assessed by the Tribunal should, therefore, be maintained.
[1097B D] The petitioners are entitled to interest at 12 per cent per annum 1096 from the date of the application for compensation to the date of payment.
