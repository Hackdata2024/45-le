The appellant succeeded to the estate consisting of the suit lands when he was a minor.
The State Government assumed management of the estate under the Bombay Court of Wards Act, 1905 and appointed the Collector as the manager of the estate.
While the estate was under the management of the Court of Wards on July 25, 1956.
the first respondent wrote to the Collector that the respondents were forming a cooperative society.
for carrying on agriculture, and that the suit lands were required for that purpose.
The Collector passed an order on July 28, 1956.
The kabuliyat was executed on August 24, 1956 by the respondents, though no cooperative society was formed.
The lease was therefore created on August 24, 1956 and according to the kabuliyat, expired on 31st May, 1957.
The Court of Wards withdrew its superintendence on May 11, 1958.
Under section 32 of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 every tenant shall be deemed to have become a statutory owner of the land on 1st April, 1957 known as the "tillers ' day". ' The Act was amended by Amending Act 13 of 1956 which came into force on August 1, 1956.
The effect of the amendment was that sections 1 to 87A were not applicable to an estate or land taken under the management of the Court of Wards.
Under section 88 of the Act, after cessation of the management by the Court of Wards, the provisions of the Act would apply to such estate.
Therefore, sections 1 to 87A of the Act were not applicable to the suit lands from August 1, 19 '56 to May 11, 1958.
The appellant filed a suit on July 11, 1958 for recovery of possession of the suit lands and mesne profits on the ground that the lease was fraudulently obtained by the respondents.
The respondents contended that they became statutory owners under section 32 or section 88 of the Act and that the civil court had no jurisdiction to hear the suit.
The trial court decreed the suit.
On appeal, the High Court held: (1) that the appellant had failed to establish that the lease was vitiated by fraud; (2) that the respondents had failed to establish that they had become statutory owners of the suit lands on or before the date of suit; (3) that the civil court had jurisdiction to decide whether the resportdents were tenants on the relevant dates namely July 28, 19 '56 or May 11, 1958, before the suit was filed, and whether they had become statutory owners, (4) but that the civil court had no jurisdiction to deal with the question as to whether the defendants were or were not tenants on the date of the suit that such question could only be decided by the Revenue authorities and that the question should be referred to the Mamlatdar accordingly.
786 In appeal to this Court, HELD: (1) On the evidence adduced, the High Court was right in its view that the lease in favour of the respondeats was not vitiated by fraud.
The evidence showed 'that the lease was granted with the knowledge that there was no cooperative society.
[795 A C] (2) (a) As during the period August 1, 1956 to May 11, 1958 sections 1 to 87A of the Act were not applicable to the suit lands, section 32 was not applicable, and therefore, the respondents could not have become statutory owners on the "tillers ' day", mentioned in section 32.
[795 G; 796 A] (b) As provided by the Kabuliyat itself the tenancy expired on May 31, 1957.
That is, there was no subsisting lease on May 11, 1958 which was the date of cessation of the management by the Court of Wards.
If there was no subsisting lease on May 11, 1958 the respondents were not tenants, and the High Court was right in its view that the respondents had failed to establish that they had become statutory owners of the land under section 32 by virtue of the first proviso to section 88.
[796 s E] (3) Section 70(b) of the Act imposes a duty on the Mamlatdar to decide whether a person is a tenant and not to decide whether a person was or was not a tenant in the past.
In the present case, the contention of statutory ownership of the respondeats was based on the question whether the respondents were tenants on July 28, 1956 or on May 11, 1958 and not whether they were tenants on July 11, 1958 the date of the suit.
The question would be therefore whether they were or were not tenants in the past.
Further, the question.
was put forward by the respondents not as an independent question but as a reason for substantiating their plea of statutory ownership.
Therefore, the plea of tenancy on the past two dates was a subsidiary plea and the main plea was of statutory ownership and the jurisdiction of the civil court cannot be held to be barred by virtue of the provisions of sections 70 and 85, as there is no exclusion, expressly or by necessary implication, of the jurisdiction of the civil court to decide the question whether the respondents had acquired title as statutory owners.
Nor is the jurisdiction of the civil court barred for considering the question whether the provisions of the Act are or are not applicable to the suit land during a particular period.
[796 H; 797 A E; G H] Secretary of State vs Mask & Co., 67 I.A. 222, 236, referred to.
(4) In the written statement, the only plea set up on behalf of the respondents Was the plea of tenancy on July 28, 1956 which was the basis of statutory ownership.
The High Court found that the tenancy was created on August 24, 1956 and that the tenancy did not subsist on May 11.
1958 when there was a cessation of the management by the Court of Wards.
There was no plea of any intervening act or transaction between May 11, 1958 and July 11, 1958, the date of suit, under which a fresh tenancy was created and which was subsisting on the date of the suit.
There was thus no issue which survived for the decision of the Mamlatdar under section 85A of the Act.
Therefore, the High Court should have decreed the suit and was in error in referring the issue whether the respondents were tenants of the land on the date of suit to the Mamlatdar.
