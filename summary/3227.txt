On three days before the election to the Meghalaya Assembly the appellant, who was the successful candidate, distributed dummy ballot papers in various places.
The dummy ballot papers contained.
as the election symbol of the first respondent, who was a rival candidate, a symbol different from that allotted to the first respondent by the Election Commission.
The first respondent successfully challenged in the High Court the election of the appellant on the ground that he was guilty of a corrupt practice under s.123(4) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
Dismissing the appeal to this Court, HELD: In a constituency consisting of more than 80% illiterate electors the consequences of such distribution of dummy ballot papers with wrong symbols would be, (a) the voters who went to the polling station would have been confused even if they did not go there with the intention of voting for the first respondent, (b) people who went there with the intention of voting for the first respondent might well have cast their votes either for the appellant or for the other candidates finding that the first respondent 's symbol was not there, or (c) they might have gone away without voting.
Therefore, the distribution must have prejudiced the prospects of the first respondent 's election.
In a case where a corrupt practice is alleged and proved it is not necessary to further show the exact number of votes which the first respondent lost or the appellant gained.
The corrupt practice itself is enough to invalidate the election.
