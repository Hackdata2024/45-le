The petitioner was detained by virtue of an order of detention passed by the District Magistrate, Jammu, under section 3(2) of the Jammu and Kashmir Preventive Detention Act, 2011 and that order was confirmed and continued by an order passed by the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir under section 12(1) of the Act after taking the opinion of the Advisory Board.
The order recited that it was necessary to detain the petitioner with a view to preventing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community and was based on the ground of alleged illicit smuggling by the petitioner of essential goods such as shaff on cloth, zari and mercury to Pakistan.
It was found that shaffon cloth and zari were not essential goods.
It was not established that the smuggling attributed to the petitioner was substantially only of.
mercury or that the smuggling as regards shaffon cloth and zari was of an inconsequential nature.
Held, that the order was bad and must be quashed.
The sub jective satisfaction of the detaining authority must be properly based on all the reasons on which it purports to be based.
If some out of those reasons are found to be non existent or irrelevant, the Court cannot predicate what the subjective satisfaction of the authority would have been on the exclusion of those reasons.
To 949 uphold the order on the remaining reasons would be to substitute the objective standards of the Court for the subjective satisfaction of the authority.
The Court must, however, be satisfied that the vague or irrelevant grounds are such as, if excluded, might reasonably have affected the subjective satisfaction of the authority.
