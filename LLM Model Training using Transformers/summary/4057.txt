HELD: The prohibition under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act and the Rules has been imposed because it is harmful to human health.
[312 G] Absence of evidence is not equal to evidence of absence.
Non mention in the Public Analyst 's report that the "colour which was mixed with powdered Chillies" was injurious to human life does not amount to the adulterant being non injurious.
When the High Court under this misconception has already reduced the sentence, this Court cannot under article 136 of the Constitution be pressurised further to follow the wrong path.
