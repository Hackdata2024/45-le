By an order passed under section 4 A of the Central Provinces and Berar Goondas Act, 1946 (X of 1946), as amended by the Madhya Pradesh Act XLIX of 950, the State of Madhya Pradesh directed the respondent to leave the district of Chhindwara, which had been specified as a proclaimed area under the Act, and the District Magistrate by another order communicated the same to the respondent.
The respondent challenged the said orders under article 226 of the Constitution on the ground that the Act violated his fundamental rights under article i9(i)(d) and (e) of the Constitution and was, therefore, invalidated by article 13 Of the Constitution.
The High Court held that sections 4 and 4 A of the impugned Act were invalid and since they were the 971 main operative provisions of the Act, the whole Act was in valid.
Held, that when a statute authorises preventive action against the citizens, it is essential that it must expressly provide that the specified authorities should satisfy themselves that the conditions precedent laid down by the statute existed before they acted thereunder.
If the statute fails to do so in respect of any such condition precedent, that is an infirmity sufficient to take the statute out of article 19(5) Of the Constitution.
Although there can be no doubt that sections 4 and 4 A of the impugned Act clearly contemplated as the primary condition precedent to any action thereunder that the person sought to be proceeded against must be a goonda, they fail to provide that the District Magistrate should first find that the person sought to be proceeded against was a goonda or provide any guidance whatsoever in that regard or afford any opportunity to the person proceeded against to show that he was not a goonda.
The definition of a goonda laid down by the Act, which is of an inclusive character, indicated no tests for deciding whether the person fell within the first part of the definition.

Although the object of the impugned Act was beyond reproach and might well attract article 19(5) of the Constitution, since the Act itself failed to provide sufficient safeguards for the protection of the fundamental rights and the operative sections were thus rendered invalid, the entire Act must fail.
