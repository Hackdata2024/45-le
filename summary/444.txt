In June, 1950, goods belonging to the appellant company were stolen and as the result of an enquiry the respondent was dismissed on the ground of gross negligence and misconduct.
He was prosecuted on a charge of theft but was acquitted in March, 1952, and thereupon he made an application before the Labour Commissioner 957 for reinstatement and compensation under section 16(2) of the Central Provinces and Barar Industrial Disputes Settlement Act, 1947.
It was contended for the appellant that the application was not main tainable because (1) the respondent was not an employee on the date of the application, having been dismissed long prior thereto and (2) his dispute was an individual and not an industrial dispute Held, (1) that the definition of "employee" in section 2(10) of the Act includes one who has been dismissed and has ceased to be in service, and that the inclusive clause therein was inserted ex abundanti cautela to repel a possible contention that employees discharged under sections 31 and 32 of the Act would not fall with Ins. 2(10) and cannot be read as importing an intention generally to exclude dismissed employees from that definition.
Western India Automobile Association vs Industrial Tribunal Bombay ([1949] F.C.R. 321), relied on.
(2) that a dispute between an employer and an employee who has been dismissed and who makes a claim for reinstatement and compensation, would be an industrial dispute within the meaning of section 2(12) of the Act, and section 16 enables the employee to enforce his individual rights against an order of dismissal, discharge, removal or suspension.
Quaere, whether a dispute simpliciter between an employer and a workman would be an industrial dispute within section 2(k) of the (XIV of 1947).
