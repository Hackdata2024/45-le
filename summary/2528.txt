The first respondent wrote letters to his wife who is the daughter c the appellant.
The letters contained defamatory imputations concerning the appellant.
The letters were handed over to the appellant and he filed a complaint for defamation against the first respondent.
The Magistrate held that a communication between spouses of a matter de (amatory of another did not amount to publication and that no evidence could be given of it under section 122 of the Evidence Act, 1872, against the first respondent, and discharged him.
The Court of Session set aside the order but the High Court restored it.
While the appeal against the order of discharge was pending in this Court a decree of nullity of marriage was passed against the first respondent on the ground of his impotency.
HELD: If the appellant sought to support his case only upon the evidence of the wife of the first respondent, 8. 122 of the Evidence Act would be a bar.
Further a marriage with a person important at the time of marriage and at the time of institution of proceedings for nullity is under the Indian Divorce Act not ab initio void; it is valid till the decree of nullity is pronounced.
Therefore, if the defamation case were to proceed and 'the wife ' should appear as a witness to give evidence about the communication made to her by her husband (the first respondent), the communication could not be deposed to unless the first respondent consented because, if the marriage was subsisting at the time when the communication was made the bar prescribed by section 122 would operate.
But the letters were in appellant 's possession and were available for being tendered in evidence, and he could prove the letters in any other manner.
Therefore, the accused (first respondent) should not have been discharged.
