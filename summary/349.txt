The petitioners, two Insurance Companies, carrying on business both in life insurance and general insurance, questioned the validity of notifications issued against them under section 52 A of the Insurance Act for appointment of Administrators to take over management of their affairs on the ground, inter alia, that section 52 A was exclusively restricted to life insurance business and the Government had no power to take oyer management of general insurance busi ness.
Held, that the Insurance Act of 1938 no doubt makes a distinction between life insurance business and general insurance business, but its main concern is to protect life insurance policy holders.
Although section 52 A of the Act has no application to an insurer who carries on business in general insurance alone, it undoubtedly applies to an insurer who combines both and gives the Central Government the power, on the report of the Controller, to appoint an Administrator to take over the management of the entire business of the insurer including general insurance business when such insurer is found to act in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the life policy holders.
That grounds not specifically taken in petitions under article 32 cannot be urged at the time of the hearing.
