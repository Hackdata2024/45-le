The appellant landlord executed a lease in respect of the disputed premises in favour of respondent 2 for three years as far back as 1 4 1942.
In 1948, a suit was brought by the appellant for eviction of the tenant for non payment of rent on the ground of conversion of the user of the premises.
The suit for possession was however dismissed but a decree dated 31 11 1948 for arrears of rent was passed and it was held that Laxmi Bank was the real tenant.
Subsequently, the Bombay High Court ordered the Bank to be wound up and in the winding up proceedings, the High Court appointed an Official Liquidator who on 16 2 1961 sold the tenancy rights to respondent No. 1.
The sale was confirmed by the High Court on the same date and as a result thereof respondent No. 1 took possession the premises on 24 2 1961.
On 5 1 1961, the landlord appellant filed an application under the Delhi Rent Control Act for eviction of Laxmi Bank.
On 31 7 1961, a decree for eviction was passed in favour of the appellant.
On 22 1 1963, respondent No. 1 filed a suit for declaration that he was a tenant of the landlord appellant.
The suit was dismissed for non prosecution on 5 5 1964 and an application to set aside the ex parte order was also dismissed and the appeal against that order also failed.
Thereafter respondent No. 1 filed an application under Section 25 of the Delhi Rent Control Act for recalling the warrant of possession issued by the Court in pursuance of the decree dated 31 7 1961 in favour of the appellant.
The Rent Controller allowed it on 20 12 1966.
An appeal to the Rent Controller Tribunal was ordered by order dated 25 11 1968 in favour of the appellant.
A second appeal filed by respondent No. 1 to the High Court was allowed in his favour and the Rent Controller 's order allowing recalling of the warrant of possession was restored.
Hence the appeal by special leave by the landlord.
Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: 1.
The application of respondent No. 1 under Section 25 of the Delhi Rent Control Act is clearly barred by the principle contained in order IX Rule 9 Civil Procedure Code.
It was the appellant who brought the previous suit which resulted in a decree for eviction of the tenant on 31 7 1961 a date when the Ist respondent had already taken possession of the premises by virtue of transfer made by the Official Liquidator.
There is nothing to show that respondent No. 1 was a tenant within the meaning of Delhi Rent Control 445 Act so as to maintain an application under section 25 of the Act, when in fact he was an unlawful sub lessee.

The language of section 14(b) of the Delhi Rent Control Act is wide enough not only to include any sub lease but even an assignment or any other mode by which possession of the tenanted premises is parted.
In view of the wide amplitude of section 14 (b), it does not exclude even in involuntary sale.
[448D E] In the instant case, the official Liquidator had merely stepped into the shoes of Laxmi Bank which was the original tenant and even if the official liquidator had transferred the tenancy interest to respondent No. 1 under the order of the Court, it was on behalf of the original tenant.
It was undoubtedly a voluntary sale which clearly fell within the mischief of section 14 (1) (b) of the Delhi Rent Control Act.
Assuming that the sale by the Official Liquidator was an involuntary sale, then it undoubtedly became an assignment as provided for by section 14 (b) of Delhi Rent Control Act.
