A rule that degraded relations are preferential heirs to undegraded ones cannot be evolved merely on logical grounds the existence of such a rule can only be justified on the basis of established custom.
Custom cannot be extended by analogy.
It must be establish ed inductively, not deductively, and it cannot be established by a priori methods.
It cannot be a matter of mere theory but must always be a matter of fact and one custom cannot be deduced from another.
