The appellant was a Head Constable attached to a malkhana where articles seized in connection with excise offences were kept in deposit.
The appellant was charged under section 5(1)(c) read with section 5(2), Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, in that he had dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriated or otherwise converted to his use these articles; the charge further stated that a sum of Rs. 9,284 1 0 was recovered from him which was disproportionate to his known sources of income.
He was acquitted of the charge under section 5(1)(c) but was convicted under section 5(2) on the ground that he had failed to account satisfactorily for the possession of Rs. 9,284 1 0 which was disproportionate to his known sources of income.
Held, that the conviction of the appellant under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, was illegal.
The only charge against the appellant was of criminal misconduct under section 5(1)(c) of the Act for dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriating property entrusted to him and of this charge he could have been convicted by invoking the rule of presumption under section 5(3).
But since this was not done and he was acquitted of that charge, he could not be convicted of criminal misconduct referred to in cls.
(a), (b) or (d) of section 5(1) for which he had not been charged.
The Courts below had proceeded wrongly on the footing as though sub section
(2) or sub section
(3) of section 5 created an offence; the offence which was punishable under section 5 (2) or which could be founded on the rule of presumption under section 5(3) was the offence of criminal misconduct of one or more of the cate gories mentioned in cls.
(a) to (d) of sub section
(1) of S 5.
