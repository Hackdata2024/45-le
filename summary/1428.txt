On February 14, 1953, the Government of Punjab referred certain disputes between the appellant company and its workmen to the Industrial Tribunal which had been consti tuted on August 29, 1953, by a notification issued under section 7 of the industrial Disputes Act, 1947, by which G, an Advo cate, was appointed as the Industrial Tribunal for Punjab.
When the reference was pending the Act was amended.
The Amendment Act inter alia repealed section 7 of the principal Act and replaced it by sections 7A, 7B and 7C, and by section 30 provided for a saving clause in respect of the proceedings pending before the Tribunal constituted under the principal Act.
On April 19, 1957, the Punjab Government issued a notification under section 7 of the Act and section 30 of the Amendment Act extending the life of the Tribunal constituted under the repealed section 7 and also extending the term of G as the member.
On the same date another Notification was issued under section 7A of the Act constituting a new Tribunal and appointing G as the Presiding Officer up to June 3, 1957.
Under section 70 (b) the age of retirement for members was fixed at sixty five and under that provision G would have to retire by June 3, 1957.
The Punjab Government intervened and passed the Industrial Disputes (Punjab Amendment) Act, 1957, raising the age of retirement of members to sixty seven years.
After G had retired on June 3, 1959, the Punjab Government issued a notification appointing another person as the Presiding Officer of the Industrial Tribunal.
The appellant challenged the legality of the reference on the grounds, inter alia, (1) that G was not qualified to be appointed to the Tribunal under section 7 (3) (c) of the Act, as he was over sixty years and, therefore, the reference to him dated 90 February 14, 1955, was incompetent, and (2) that the Indus trial Disputes (Punjab Amendment) Act, 1937, was passed with a view to benefit a single individual, G, and, therefore, was void as offending article 14 of the Constitution of India.
Held, (1) section 7(3)(c) of the , did not import any qualification based on the age of the person to be appointed, and that the appointment of G on August 29, 1953, was valid under that section.
On the true Construction of article 217 of the Constitution of India, the prescription of age therein is a condition attached to the duration of the office and not a "qualifica tion" for appointment to it.
