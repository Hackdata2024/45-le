The appellant was convicted by a first class Magistrate under section 406, I.P.C., and was sentenced to two years regorous imprisonment, a fine of Rs. 2000/ and, in default to one year 's further rigorous imprisonment.
On the question of the period of imprisonment that could be imposed in default of payment of fine, HELD : Even if section 65, I.P.C., could be applied the period of imprisonment in default of payment of fine could not exceed nine months since an offence under section 406 I.P.C. is punishable with imprisonment up to three years.
But reading sections 32 and 33, Cr.
P.C. together the Magistrate could not have awarded more than six months imprisonment in default of payment of fine.
The terms section 33 Cr.
P.C. and section 65 I.P.C., must therefore be harmonised.
Hence it must be held that while a Magistrate 's power are specifically limited by section 33 Cr.
P.C. they must also be exercised so as not to contravene section 65 I.P.C. [908 D G] Therefore, just as a First Class Magistrate trying an offence punishable under section 406 I.P.C., cannot impose the maximum sentence of imprisonment prescribed by the section, because this powers of awarding imprisonment are Specifically limited to a term not exceeding two years by section 32, Cr.
P.C. so also necessary , by resorting to section 65 I.P.C., award a period of imprisonment in default of payment of fine, on the erroneous assumption that he has the power to award the maximum sentence prescribed by section 406 1 P C. [908 G H; 909 A] Hence, three sentence of imprisonment in default of fine cannot exceed six months.
