The appellant company was carrying on business in Bombay as commission agents.
In the course of assessment proceedings for the year 1954 55, the Income tax Officer noticed from the ssee 's boo s of account that the assessee had business connections with certain nonresident parties and found that the transactions disclosed that through the assessee those non resident parties were receiving income, profits and gains.
He considered that section 43 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, was applicable to the assessee and issued on March 27, 1957, a notice under section 34 of the Act for assessment of the assessee as an agent of the said non resident parties.
The assessee pleaded, inter alia, that the proceedings intiated by the Income tax Officer under section 34 were barred since the notice issued by him was after the expiry of one year from the end of the assessment year 1954 55, but the Income tax Officer rejected the contention relying on the amendment made to the proviso to section 34(l)(b)(iii) by the Finance Act, 1956, under which the period of one year was changed to two years.
The amendment was given retrospective operation upto April 1, 1956, but since the power to issue a notice under the unamended Act had come to an end on March 31, 1956, the question was whether the Income tax Officer could issue a notice of assessment to a person as an agent of a non resident party under the amended provision when the period prescribed for such a notice had before the amended Act came into force expired.
HELD:The proceedings initiated by the Income tax Officer by the notice dated March 27, 1957, were barred; the authority of the Incometax Officer under the Indian Income tax Act before it was amended by the Finance Act of 1956 having come to an end, the amending provision would not entitle him to commence a proceeding even though at the date when he issued the notice it was within the period provided by the amendment.
Notwithstanding the fact that there was no determinable point of time between the expiry of the time provided under the old Act and the commencement of the Amendment Act, in the absence of an express provision or clear implication, the legislature could not be said to have intended to attribute to the Amending provision a greater retros pectivity than was expressly mentioned.
