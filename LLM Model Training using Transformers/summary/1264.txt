The appellant was elected as a member of the Bihar Legis lative Assembly in a bye election from the Dhanbad constituency by a majority of votes while the nomination paper of the respondent was rejected by the Returning Officer on the ground that the respondent 's proposer had nominated him for election from the Bihar and not Dhanbad assembly constituency inasmuch as in the nomination paper he wrote the word "Bihar" before the words "assembly constituency" instead of the word "Dhanbad".
This defect arose out of a mistake in the Hindi printed form of the nomination paper which did not exactly conform to the form prescribed by the Rules.
In an election petition by the respondent the Election Tribunal held that his nomination paper was rightly rejected but on appeal the High Court held that it was improperly rejected.
On appeal by special leave, Held, that in view of the mistake that occurred in the 402 printing of the form and in view of the fact that the name of the constituency for which the election was being held was already in the heading, the defect in the filling up of the form which resulted from a mistake of the proposer in putting the word "Bihar" instead of the word "Dhanbad" was not of a substantial character as contemplated under s 33 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
Held, further, that the defect arising out of the fact that columns nos.
2 and 5 were not properly filled was not of a substantial character as the Returning Officer bad no difficulty in checking that the proposer and the candidate were voters on the electoral rolls.
