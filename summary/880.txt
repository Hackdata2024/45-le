The management having refused to comply with some of the demands raised by workmen, the matter was referred for conciliation.
Efforts at conciliation failed on November 30, 1955.
on the very next day the union gave a strike notice and actually went on strike with effect from December 9, 1958.
On January 3, 1956, the Government referred the dispute to the Industrial Tribunal and the strike was called off on January 5, 1956.
The question as to whether the workmen were entitled to get wages for the period of the ' strike was along with some other grounds referred to the Tribunal.
The Tribunal took the view that both the parties were to blame for the strike and that the workmen were entitled to get 50% of the emoluments for the period of strike: Held, that on the facts of the case the strike was unjustified and that the workmen were not entitled to any wages for the period.
When conciliation attempts failed it was reasonable for the union to take the normal and reasonable course provided by law to settle the dispute by asking .
the Government to make a reference to the Industrial Tribunal before it decided to strike.
A strike which is a legitimate weapon in the hands of the workmen would not be ordinarily justified if hastily resorted to without exhausting reasonable avenues for peaceful achievement of the object.
