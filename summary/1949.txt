Because certain industrial disputes were pending before the Industrial Tribunal at the relevant time between the appellant and its employees, the appellant filed an application under section 33(2), (b) asking for approval of action which it proposed to take against its employee the respondent.
The appellant urged that this application was made as a matter of abundant caution and it wanted the Tribunal to consider the question as to whether the respondent was a workman concerned in the relevant industrial dispute at all before dealing with the merits of the application.
The Tribunal, being of the view that if the appellant thought that s, 33 did not apply, it should withdraw the application and take the consequences, dealt with the merits of the application.
In appeal by special leave: HELD: The Tribunal was in error in not considering the preliminary point raised by the appellant that the respondent was not a workman concerned with the main industrial dispute and as such the application made by it was unnecessary.
[431E] It is plain that in a situation like the present, where judicial decisions differed on the construction of the words "workman concerned in such dispute", even if the appellant took the view that the workman against whom it was taking action was not a workman concerned with the main industrial disputes, it would be justified in refusing to take the risk of deciding the said point for itself.
It would he legiti mate for an employer to make an application under section 33 without prejudice to his case that section 33 did not apply.
[431D E] Case law referred to.
