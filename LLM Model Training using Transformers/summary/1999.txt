The appellant visited Far Eastern countries during the years 1951 to 1956 after obtaining from the Government of India the necessary foreign exchange for the purpose of meeting his expenditure during his tour.
He deposited the unspent part of the foreign exchange in different branches of the Chartered Bank in those countries.
The Director, Enforcement Directorate, Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, took proceedings under section 19(2) of the Act and found him guilty of contravening section 4(1) and (3).
The order was confirmed on appeal by the Foreign Exchange Regulation Appellate Board.
In the appeal to this Court.
HELD : (i) The appellant could not be held to have contravened the provisions of section 4(1).
[654 F] To attract section 4(1), the appellant should have lent foreign exchange to a person who was not an authorised dealer.
The Bank, no doubt, was not an authorised dealer, but, when a person deposits free currency in the current account of a bank in order to draw it whenever necessary for the purpose for which it was given, it is not possible to hold that he enters into a contract of loan with the bank, within the meaning of section 4((1).
Ordinarily a deposit of an amount in the current account of a bank creates a debt, but it need not necessarily involve a contract of loan.
[653 E; 654 C. D E] Shanti Prasad Jain vs Director of Enforcement, , followed.
(ii) The tribunals were right in holding that the appellant had contravened section 4(3).
[655 A] Under this sub section, the appellant should have sold the unspent foreign exchange to an authorised dealer without delay.
Since he had kept the amount in the current account of various branches of the Bank for a number of years, he was guilty of contravening the provision.
[654 H; 655 A]
