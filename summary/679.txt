The appellant was tried for an offence under section 165A of the Indian Penal Code for having abetted K, an Inspector in charge of checking paddy, in the commission of an offence by the latter under section 161 of the Code.
The prosecution case was that while the complainant was taking paddy for sale K demanded Rs. 200/as bribe and threatened him that unless the money was paid the paddy would be seized, that at the instance of K the complainant handed over the bribe money to the appellant for being counted and that the latter after checking the money paid it to K.
The Special judge who tried the case accepted the prosecution story and convicted K under section 161 of the Indian Penal Code and the appellant for abetment of the offence.
On appeal, the High Court was of the opinion that the evidence was not strong enough to prove payment to K, and set aside his conviction, but confirmed that of the appellant on the ground that money was taken by him for payment to K as illegal gratification and whether he actually paid it to him or not the offence fell under section 165A. Held, that the conviction of the appellant for abetment under section 165A of the Indian Penal Code must under the circumstances be set aside.
On the facts found, the appellant received the money in the presence of and for and on behalf of K and if K was acquitted on the ground that no offence under section 161 was committed, then no question of intentionally aiding by any act or omission the commission of the offence arose.
Consequently, the appellant 's conviction for the offence of abetment wag not maintainable.
