The workmen of the appellant company claimed four months, wages including dearness allowance as bonus for the year 1952, and retrospective operation of the increased wage scale to be fixed by the Industrial Tribunal from March 1, 1952.
The appellant agreed to the increased wage scale suggested by the Tribunal but wanted that it should be linked to some guaranteed production, and opposed its operation retrospectively on the ground that there had been eliberate slowing down of production by the workmen in the previous years.
The Tribunal found that there was some justification in the appellant 's contention that there was considerable go slow which had affected production and ordered that retrospective effect should be given to its order relating to increase in wages which was passed on May 13, 1957, from June 1, 1956, and not March 1, 1952, as claimed by the workmen, The increased wages were not linked to any guaranteed production but it was made clear that the workers would give certain reasonable production to which the workmen agreed.
The Tribunal granted five months basic wages by way of bonus on the basis of the Full Bench formula which is generally applied to these matters.
On appeal by the Appellant company by special leave : Held, that there was no reason for interference with the order of the Tribunal fixing the date as June 1, 1956, from which the increased wages should come into force and that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to award five months ' basic wages by way of bonus.
For the purpose of the Full Bench formula, the incometax payable has to be deducted on the figures worked out according to the formula and it is immaterial what the actual income tax paid is whether more or less.
