Pursuant to tho policy decision taken by the Andhra Pradesh Government in 1964 that the secondary school duration should be 10 years instead of 11 years and it should be followed by a two years ' intermediate course, the Government decided in G.O.Ms. 1920, Education, dated 25.10.1968 that in the existing colleges the two years ' intermediate course should be introduced and laid down in G.O.Ms. 2063, Education, dated 25.8.69 the staff pattern and pay scales of staff m Junior Colleges started for the two years ' intermediate course.
In G.O.Ms. 2186, Education, dated 17.9.1969 the Government issued instructions regarding the absorption of Post Graduate teachers in Junior Colleges on the basis of the Post Graduate degree and the number of years of service rendered by them.
It was stated in that G.O. that all the existing Post Graduates who will be absorbed as Junior Lecturers in Junior Colleges will be appointed temporarily as Junior Lecturers pending framing of adhoc rules in due course.
The Government ordered in G.O. Ms, 1147, Education, dated 4.6.1970 that in the common seniority list first rank should be given only to those who have secured first and second class Post Graduate degree.
On 19.9.1973 the Government framed Adhoc Rules, 1973 with retrospective effect from 1.8.1969 for the temporary post of Junior Lecturers in Junior Colleges.
Rule 13 of the Adhoc Rules, 1973 says that seniority of Post Graduate Assistants appointed as Junior Lecturers shall be a determined with reference to the dates of their actual appointment as Post Graduate Assistants.
Rule 3 states that post graduates with first or second class degrees are to be given preference over Post Graduates holding third class degrees.
On 19.6.1974 the Government framed Adhoc Rules, 1974 for the temporary posts of principals of Junior Colleges with retrospective effect from 1.8.1969.
Rule 6 of the Adhoc Rules, 1974 prescribes first or second class Post Graduate degree for promotion of Junior Lecturers to the posts of Principals of Junior Colleges.
Rule 8 of the Adhoc Rules 1974 says that a person who held the post of Principal of a Junior College immediately before 546 the issue of these Rules shall be continued as Principal and given option either A to continue in the post of Principal or to revert to his original post.
The appellants in Civil Appeals 1652 1659 of 1978 who were working as Post Graduate Assistants and were first or second class Post Graduate degree holders were appointed as Junior Lecturers in 1969.
Soon after the Adhoc Rules, 1973 were framed the second respondent, Joint Director of Higher Education, prepared a subjectwise seniority list in 1974 and on the basis of their seniority in that seniority list all the appellants except one were promoted as Principals of different Junior Colleges.
The first respondent State, under the directions of the High Court in a separate proceeding to prepare the seniority list as per Rule 13(1) of the Adhoc Rules, 1973, prepared a revised seniority list in 1976 in which respondents 3 to 8, who were third class Post Graduate degree holders and were appointed as Junior Lecturers in 1970 and 1975 were placed as seniors to the appellants.
The appellants as petitioners filed petitions in the Administrative Tribunal for quashing the revised seniority list of 1976 and restoring the earlier seniority list of 1974 or in the alternative for declaring that Rule 13(1) of the Adhoc Rules, 1973 is violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
The petitioners contended that under the Adhoc Rules Post Graduate Assistants with first and second class Post Graduate degrees should be treated as one group and as senior to Post Graduate Assistants with third class Post Graduate degrees The Tribunal held that the seniority list of 1976 framed as per Rule 13(1) of the Adhoc Rules, 1973 having precedence over the earlier executive instruction is valid and as the petitioners and respondents 3 to 8 belonged to the same category of Post Graduate Assistants, there is no question of violation of Articles I 1 and 16 of the Constitution.
The appellants in Civil Appeal 415 of 1979 who were working as School Assistants in Higher Secondary Schools and were third class Post Graduates were appointed as Junior Lecturers in Junior Colleges in terms of Rule 3 of t the Adhoc Rules, 1973.
Pending the framing of Adhoc Rules for the temporary posts of Principals of Junior Colleges, the second respondent, Director of Public Instructions, issued proceedings dated 14.3.1974 promoting under Rule 10(a) (i) of the State and Subordinate Services Rules seven third class Post Graduate Junior Lecturers as Principals of Junior Colleges.
The appellants as petitioners challenged in the Administrative Tribunal these Adhoc promotions.
They also challenged the validity of Rule 6 of the Adhoc Rules, 1974 on the ground that it violates Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
The Tribunal held that Rule 6 does not contravene Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
The Tribunal found nothing objectionable in Rule 8 of the Adhoc Rules, 1974 which protects the right of third class Post Graduate degree holders who had been promoted under Rule 10(a) (i) of the State and Subordinate Services Rules pending framing of Adhoc Rules.
Allowing Civil Appeals 1652 59 and dismissing Civil Appeal 415, ^ HELD: There is no need to quash Rule 13(1) of the Adhoc Rules, 1973 which has to be interpreted in the manner indicated in the Judgment and 547 seniority has to be fixed accordingly.
The seniority list of 1976 is quashed and the seniority list of 1974 is restored.
Rule 6 of the Adhoc Rules, 1974 is valid.
[571 H, 572 A] There is no reason to think that the Government intended by Rule 13(1) of the Adhoc Rules, 1973 to take away from First and second class Post Graduate Junior Lecturers the preference shown to them over third class Post Graduate Junior Lecturers in the executive instructions especially G.O. Ms. 1147, Education, dated 4,6.1970 and even in Rule 3(1) and (2) of the Adhoc Rules, 1973.
Rules 3(1) and (2) and 13(1) have to be read together.
Only then there will be harmony between those rules.
If Rule 13(1) is read without reference to Rule 3(1) and (2) the consequence will be disharmony and the first and second class Post Graduate Junior Lecturers who were given preference over third class Post Graduate Junior Lecturers will be placed in a less advantageous and inferior position as compared with third class Post Graduate Junior Lecturers as regards seniority alone, which will not even help them in the matter of promotion as Principals of Junior Colleges in view of Rule 6 of Adhoc Rules, 1974 so long as they do not improve their academic attainment by obtaining a first or second class Post Graduate Degree.
Every rule in the Adhoc Rules must be given its full, natural and legal effect.
There is no doubt that Rule 13(1) is inartistically worded though when read with Rule 3(1) and (2) it would be clear that the principle laid down in it has to be applied separately to each of the three categories of Junior Lecturers mentioned in Rule 3(1) and (2).
Each of these three categories forms a distinct and separate category.
The first category consists of first and second class Post Graduates, and on their appointment as Junior Lecturers their inter se seniority has to be fixed under Rule 13(1) with reference to the dates of their original appointment as Post Graduate School Assistants.
When Post Graduates with not less than five years of service, working as Post Graduate School Assistants are appointed as Junior Lecturers their inter se seniority has to be fixed like wise under Rule 13(1) on the basis of the dates of their original appointment as Post Graduate School Assistants.
Similarly, when Post Graduates with less than five years of service, working as Post Graduate School Assistants are appointed as Junior Lecturers their inter se seniority has to be fixed on the basis of the dates of their original appointment as Post Graduate School Assistants.
If Rule 13(1) is interpreted in this manner, no disharmony will result from applying all the adhoc rules.
It is only by constructing Rule 13(1) in this manner the Government framed the seniority list of 1974.
[569 D H 570 A F] The object of achieving excellence in educational institutions like Junior Colleges is a laudable one, and excellence in academic attainments of heads of such institutions is a relevant fact.
Promotion of Junior Lecturers as Principals is based only on merit judged by their academic distinction which cannot be said to be discriminatory.
Prescribing a first or second class Post Graduate Degree for the head of an educational institution has a direct nexus with the object of excellence sought to be achieved, and it cannot be said to be discriminatory.
Therefore, it is not possible to hold that Rule 6 of the Adhoc Rules? 1974 is liable to be struck down as being discriminatory and illegal.
[572 G H, 573 A] 548 section M. Pandit vs State of Gujarat, not applicable.
The promotion of seven third class Post Graduate Junior Lecturers as Principals were irregular having regard to the fact that even for appointment as Junior Lecturers preference has to be given to first and second class Post Graduate School Assistants.
The irregularity has been sought to be overlooked by providing a saving clause by way of Rule 8 of the Adhoc Ruler, 1974.
It is not possible to think that there could have been any valid necessity to continue those adhoc promotions made even after the Adhoc Rules, 1974 were framed within about three month of those promotions.
There is no meaning in providing for the option in that rule as it is not likely that a person who has been promoted as Principal would voluntarily opt for reverting to his original post of Junior Lecturer.
However, having regard to the long lapse of time it is not desirable to declare those appointments as illegal.
[573 E H, 574 A] Rule 33(c) of the Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate Services Rules applies to persons who were transferred from one class or category of service to another class or category of the same service and would not apply to the fact of the present case where Junior Lecturers have been appointed by election amongst Post Graduate School Assistants in the manner indicated in Rule 3(1) and (2) of the Adhoc Rules and there is no question of transfer of Post Graduate School Assistants as Junior Lecturers.
