The respondent was carrying on business as an excise con tractor in the Civil and Military Station of Bangalore in the State of Mysore, called the retroceded area.
The jurisdiction ' over this area was originally exercised by the Governor General in Council by virtue of an agreement with the Maharaja of Mysore, and the income tax law applicable was the Indian Income tax Act, 1922.
On July 26, 1947, the retroceded area was given back to the State of Mysore but the income tax law in force in that area prior to that date continued to have effect and be operative till June 30, 1948, on which date was promulgated the Mysore Income tax Act and Excess Profits Tax (Application to the Retroceded Area) (Emergency) Act, 1948, the effect of which was that the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, stood repealed and the Mysore Income tax Act, 1923, came into force subject to certain saving provisions.
On August 5, 1948, was promulgated the Retroceded Area (Application of Laws) Act, 1948.
Between 1947 and 1950 there were political and constitutional changes which ultimately resulted in Mysore becoming a Part B State within the Constitution of India.
The legal effect of these changes was that the income tax law applicable to the retroceded area till June 30, 1948, was the Indian Income tax Act, 1922 ; from July 1, 1948, the Mysore Income tax Act, 1923, became applicable except that the Indian Income tax Act continued to apply in respect of the total income chargeable to income tax in the retroceded area prior to July 1, 1948, and the provisions of that Act as in force in the retroceded area prior to that date applied to all proceedings relating to the assessment of such income upto the stage of assessment and determination of income tax payable thereon.
This position continued till April 1, 1950, when the Finance Act, 1950, came into force and as a result the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, became applicable again to the retroceded area, subject to the saving provisions of section 13(1) of the former Act.
In respect of the assessment for the four years between 1945 and 1949, the respondent was assessed to income tax under the law then in force in that area; subsequently, in 1954 the Income tax Officer served a notice on the respondent under section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, for the purpose of assessing " escaped " or " under assessed " income chargeable to income tax for the said years.
The respondent challenged the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officer to take proceedings under section 34 or to make an order of re assessment on the grounds inter alia (1) that section 34 Of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, was not saved by section 13(1) of the Finance Act, 1950, because what was saved was the prior law " for the purposes of the levy, assessment and collection of income tax ", which expression did not include re assessment proceedings, (2) that the 787 financial agreement made between the President of India and the Rajpramukh of Mysore dated February 28, 1950, rendered the impugned proceedings unconstitutional and void, (3) that the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, as in force in the retroceded area stood repealed on June 30, 1948, by the Mysore Income tax and Excess Profits (Application to the Retroceded Area) (Emergency) Act, 1948, and the saving provisions in section 5(b) thereof or in para (2), sub para (b) of Sch.
A to the Retroceded Area (Application of Laws) Act, 1948, did not save section 34 in so far as it permitted re assessment proceedings in respect of years in which there had been an assessment already, and (4) that after June 30, 1948, and until April 1, 1950, the Income tax Officer in the retroceded area could re open the assessment under section 34 Of the Mysore Income tax Act, 1923, within a period of four years specified therein, but there was no authority to re open the assessment under section 34 Of the Indian Income tax Act.
Held : (1) that the expression " levy, assessment and collection of income tax " in section 13(1) Of the Finance Act, 1950, was wide enough to comprehend re assessment proceedings under section 34 Of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, and that the financial agreement between the President of India and the Rajpramukh of Mysore, on a true construction of the recommendations of the Indian States Finance Enquiry Committee, did not render the impugned proceedings unconstitutional or void ; Lakshmana Shenoy vs The Incomc tax Officer, Ernakulam, [1959] S.C.R. 751, followed.
(2) that the saving provisions in the Mysore Income tax and Excess Profits (Application to the Retroceded Area) (Emergency) Act, 1948, and the Retroceded Area (Application of Laws) Act, 1948, made the prior law available in all cases in which the income was assessed or was assessable according to that law before July 1, 1948, and, therefore, they saved section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, with regard to re assessment proceedings ; City Tobacco Mart and Others vs Income tax Officer, Urban Circle, Bangalore, A.I.R. 1955 Mys.
49, overruled.
Hirjibhai Tribhuwandas vs Income tax Officer, Rajnandgaon and another, A.I.R. 1957 M. P. 171, approved.
(3) that the Income tax Officer had the authority to re open the assessments in the present case because the period of limitation was that laid down in section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act, as it was in force in the retroceded area prior to July 1, 1948.
