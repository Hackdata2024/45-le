The respondent gave notice to the appellants terminating the lease of agricultural land situated within two miles of the limits of the Municipality and filed a suit for eviction.
The suit was contested, inter alia, on the ground that under the provisions of the Bombay Tenancy Act, 1939, the defendants had acquired tenancy rights.
The civil Judge, inter alia, held that the 1939 Act was repealed by the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Land Act, 1948, which did not apply to the suit land, as it was within two miles of the limits of the Surat Borough Municipality and decreed the suit.
On appeal, the District Judge held that the 1948 Act applied to the Suit land and set aside the decree of the trial Court.
In second appeal by the plaintiff, the High Court held that the suit land was within two miles of the limits of the Municipality and therefore, the 1948 Act did not apply to the suit land.
On appeal by Special Leave the appellants contended that their rights under the 1939 Act were saved and preserved under section 89(2) of the 1948 Act with the result that the lease extended to 10 years under the 1939 Act was saved thereunder, and by reason of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands (Amendment) Act, 1952, which brought the suit land within the scope of the 1948 Act, their rights so preserved came to be governed by the provisions of he 1948 Act and, therefore, they could not be evicted except in the manner prescribed by the provisions of the Act.
The respondent contended that the saving provision in section 89(2) of the 1948 Act operates only if there is no express provision to the contrary and that the saving of the appellant 's right would be otiose, as he could not enforce his right under the 1948 Act.
Held:(i) Before the suit was disposed of, the 1952 Act came into force, and by reason of the extension of the 1948 Act to the suit land, the respondent could not evict the appellants except in the manner prescribed by the 1948 Act.
(ii)The respondent 's contention must be rejected.
There is an express provision found in section 88(1) of the 1948 Act, in as much as it says that the provisions of sections 1 to 87 will not apply to the area in question.
(iii)As there was a right recognized by law there was a remedy and, therefore.
in the absence of any special provisions indicating a 774 particular forum for enforcing a particular right the general law of the land would naturally take its course.
The High Court, therefore, was wrong in holding that the appellants could not claim the benefit of the provisions of the 1948 Act.
