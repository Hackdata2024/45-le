Item 5 of entry 4(1) of the First Schedule to the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944, imposes an excise duty of Rs. 1 10 nP. per kilogram on tobacco other than flue cured and not actually used for the manufacture of cigarettes, smoking mixtures for pipes and cigarettes or birds in the whole leaf form.
Item 6 imposes a duty of Rs. 2 20 nP. per kilogram on tobacco in the broken leaf form.
The petitioners who dealt in tobacco in the broken leaf form contended that their tobacco could not be distinguished on any rational basis from the whole leaf form in Item 5 and the imposition of a double tariff on their tobacco was invalid as it was based on unconstitutional discrimination, the tariff being on the basis of use to which the tobacco was put.
119 Held, that there was no unconstitutional discrimination in the imposition of the excise duty on tobacco in the broken leaf form.
Tobacco in the broken leaf form was capable of being used in the manufacture of biris while tobacco in the whole leaf form could not be so used economically.
The two forms of tobacco were different by the test of capability of user.
The tariff was not based either wholly or even primarily by reference to the use of tobacco.
There was a clear and unambiguous distinction between tobacco in the whole leaf form covered by item 5 and tobacco in the broken leaf form covered by item 6 which had a reasonable relation to the object intended by the imposition of the tariff.
