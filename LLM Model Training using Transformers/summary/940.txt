The appellant, a private limited company, was incorporated in 1954 in the former Kotah State which had integrated with the United States of Rajasthan in 1949.
The United States of Rajasthan became State of Rajasthan, a Part B State.
The Indian Finance Act, 1950, made the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, applicable to Part B States with effect from April 1, 1950, whereupon Rajasthan became a taxable territory.
The Income tax (Amendment) Act, 1953, amended section 14(2)(C) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922.
Thereupon the Income tax authorities sought to tax the profits and income of the appellant for the assessment year 1950 51 who claimed exemption under section 14(2)(C) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, as it stood before the amendment in 1953.
The question for decision was whether in view of the decision of this Court in Madan Gopal 's case it was still open to the appellant to contend that the amendment operated from April 1, 1950 and that income accrued prior to April x, 1950, was still exempt although the exemption was withdrawn only from April 1, 1950.
Held, that the withdrawal of the exemption in the assessment year 1950 51 conversely affected the income of the previous year 1949 50.
The application of the Indian Income tax Act made Rajasthan a taxable territory subject to the Indian Income tax law and Parliament was competent to enact a new law for the area, just as it did for the whole of the rest of India.
The fiction in the amendment made in section 14(2)(C) made the exemption in respect of liability to tax the income for the year 1949 50 to disappear as if it had never been granted and obliterated the exemption.
The whole purpose and intent of the amendment was to reach this result from the assessment year 1950 51 onwards, and there could be no saving.
The argument assumes the premise that the Income tax Act was incorporated in the Indian Finance Act, 1950, but there is neither precedent nor warrant for the assumption that when one Act applies another Act to some territory, the latter Act must be taken to be incorporated in the former Act.
It may be otherwise, if there were words to show that the earlier Act is to be deemed to be re enacted by the new Act.
