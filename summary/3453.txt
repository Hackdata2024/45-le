Misconduct was imputed to the appellant by his employer, the second respondent.
The then Secretary of the bank enquired into the allegations and, after issuing a notice to the appellant for showing cause against punishment, accepted his explanation and dropped the proceedings.
Thereafter, the Managing Director of the Bank opined that the said Secretary was not empowered to punish a bank employee, and therefore, the proceedings culminating in the exoneration of the appellant were invalid.
The proceedings were revived, and the appellant was suspended.
His writ petition under articles 226 and 227 was dismissed by the High Court.
On appeal by special leave, the appellant challenged the revival of the proceedings against him, as illegal and opposed to natural justice.
Dismissing the appeal, the Court.
^ HELD: (1) There is no present grievance of punitive action which can be ventilated in court.
The writ petition is premature since no action has been taken finally, against the appellant.
[687A] (2) The co operative bank has not been able to show any power to suspend an employee pending an enquiry.
If that be so, the suspension of the appellant is plainly without the pale of law.
[687B]
