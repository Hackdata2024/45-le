The firm consisting of the appellant and another, carrying on managing agency business, was on March 31, 1951, assessed to excess profits tax for the year 1942 and the broken period from January, 1943 to March 4, 1943.
The prescribed notices were served not on the appellant but on the other partner who, under the terms of the partnership deed, was the managing partner.
On March 4, 1943, the managing partner gave notice of dissolution of the firm and thereupon the appellant sued him for dissolution from such date as might be specified by the court.
The trial Court upheld the dissolution as and from the date notified by the managing partner but on appeal the High Court by its judgment rendered in 1953 fixed March 10, 1949, as the date of the dissolution.
An appeal taken to the Supreme Court from this decision of the High Court was still pending.
The appellant challenged the validity of the order of assessment and the consequent proceedings for recovery of the tax assessed, under article 226 of the Constitution on the grounds, (a) that there was a dissolution of the firm on March 4, 1943, and that notices served thereafter on the managing partner would not bind him, (b) that there was no demand of the tax due from him under section 29 of the Indian Income tax Act and that, consequently, the tax could not be recovered from him under section 46(2) of the Act, but the High Court dismissed his application.
Held, that the appellant could not be allowed to plead a prior dissolution and the assessment was binding on him.
Even assuming that the partnership stood dissolved on the date of the assessment, his position would not be different.
Under the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, the unit of assessment was not the firm but the business, and an order of assessment passed after notice to the managing partner would be valid and binding on the appellant under section 44 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, as modified by the Central Board of Revenue under section 21 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940.
A.G. Pandu Rao vs Collector of Madras, (1954) 26 I.T. R. 99 and Bose vs Manindra Lal Goswami, , approved.
789 No separate notice of demand under section 29 of the Indian Income tax Act, specifically addressed to the appellant, was necessary in order to recover the tax by the mode prescribed by section 46(2) of the Act.
Under the proviso to section 21 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, the appellant was an assessee within the meaning of section 29 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, and the notice of demand served on the managing partner was notice to the appellant by virtue of section 63 of the latter Act made applicable by section 21 of the former.
