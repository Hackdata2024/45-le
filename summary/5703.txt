Petitioner is the assessee.
For the assessment year 1974 75 he submitted his return of income showing a total income of Rs.3,113 and stated that he derived this income from two stores which he had been running.
On May 12, 1973 in a search by the Customs authorities, 565 watches of foreign make of the value of Rs.87,455 were seized from the petitioner 's bedroom.
A panchnama was prepared.
The Income Tax Officer issued a notice dated January 19, 1974 to the petitioner to show cause why a sum of Rs.87,455 the value of the watches seized should not be treated as his concealed income and brought to tax under section 69A of the Act.
He further directed issuance of notice under section 271(1)(c) of the Act.
Being aggrieved the petitioner filed an appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who dismissed the appeal holding that in view of the order passed by the Collector of Customs confiscating the watches and levying penalty of Rs.2 lakhs under the Customs Act, the Income Tax Officer was justified in including the cost of watches in the income of the assessee for the assessment year 1974 75.
789 Thereafter on March 29, 1978 the Assistant Commissioner issued a notice of penalty under section 271(1)(c) of the Act, imposing a penalty of Rs.90,000.
The two appeals filed by the petitioner were dismissed by the Income tax Appellate Tribunal, and the petitioner sought a reference to the High Court under section 256(1) of the Act.
The High Court held that: (i) by virtue of the search in the house of the petitioner the watches were seized and a Panchnama was prepared, that under Section 110 of the it clearly establishes that the possession of the wrist watches was found with the petitioner, that as the petitioner did not adduce any evidence, he had not discharged the onus by proving that the wrist watches did not belong to him, the Tribunal had rightly held that the value of the wrist watches is the income of assessee, and (ii) that in view of the Explanation to section 271(1)(c) the Department had discharged the burden of establishing concealment.
The reference was accordingly answered against the assessee.
Dismissing the Special Leave Petition, ^ HELD: 1.
The expression 'income ' as used in section 69A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 has a wide meaning which meant any thing which came in or resulted in gain.[794D] 2.
Section 110 of the Evidence Act provides that where a person was found in possession of anything the onus of proving that he was not the owner was on the person who affirms that he was not the owner.
The High Court in J.S. Parker vs V.B. Palekar, held that what was meant by saying that the Evidence Act did not apply to proceedings under the Income Tax Act was that the rigour of the rules of evidence contained in the Evidence Act, was not applicable but that does not mean that when the taxing authorities were desirous in invoking the principles of the Evidence Act in proceedings before them, they were prevented from doing so.

All that section 110 of the Evidence Act does is that it embodies a salutary principle of common law jurisprudence which could be attracted to a set of circumstances that satisfy its condition.
[794B] 4.
In the instant case, possession of the wrist watches was found with the petitioner.
The petitioner did not adduce any evidence, far less 790 discharged the onus of proving that the wrist watches in question did not belong to him.
Hence, the High Court held, and according to this Court rightly, that the value of the wrist watches is the income of the assessee by virtue of Section 69A of the Act.
[793D E] 5.
The amendment to the Explanation to section 271(1)(c) by the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act 1975 is prospective in effect.
[795G] 6.
In the instant case, the assessee had shown only a total income of Rs.3113 and subsequently the raiding party seized wrist watches worth Rs.87,455.
The value of that income was included in the assessable income of the assessee.
The total assessable income of the assessee came to Rs.90,568 whereas the returned income was Rs.3,113 which was certainly less than 80% of the total income and, as such, Explanation to section 271(1)(c) applied.
Accordingly, the Revenue has discharged the onus of proving concealment of income.
[795E] Vishwakarma Industries vs Commissioner of Income tax, and Commissioner of Income Tax vs Bherulal Shrikishan, , approved.
Though the penalty proceedings are penal in nature, in the facts of this case the onus on the Revenue has been duly discharged.
