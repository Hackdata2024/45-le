The respondent was a Sales tax Officer under the Uttar Pradesh Government.
Inquiries against him in respect of some charges of corruption were first made by the Assistant Commissioner of Sales tax who examined some witnesses.
The enquiry was then passed on to the Commissioner who neither examined the witnesses against the respondent himself nor gave an opportunity to the respondent, despite the latter 's repeated 'requests to produce his defence witnesses.
On orders of dismissal being passed after the enquiry the respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court which succeeded.
The State appealed.
It was conceded on behalf of the State that the enquiry was under sub (1) or r. 55 of the Civil Services (Classification Control and Appeal) Rules.
The distinction between 'sub:ft. (1) and (3) was considered.
HELD: The third sub rule deals with the unsuitability of an officer for the service or with a charge for any specific fault.
This fault means a fault in the execution of his duties and not a misconduct such as taking scribe etc.
which are charges of a more serious nature affecting the character of the individual concerned.
The collocation of the words any specific fault ' or 'on account of unsuitability for service ' give the clue to the distinction between the third sub rule and the first sub rule.
[852B C] Sub rule (1) of r. 55 is the general rule for enquiries when the conduct of a person is inquired into for misconduct.
A person cannot the charged with criminal conduct without affording him adequate opportunity to clear his character.
If therefore the procedure under the first sub rule had to be followed adequate opportunity had to be given to the respondent to lead evidence on his own behalf to clear himself.
No such opportunity having been given the enquiry could not be said to comply with the elementary principles of natural justice and the High Court rightly held that the enquiry was vitiated.
