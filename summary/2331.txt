The appellants along with two others were charged with having entered into a criminal conspiracy in pursuance of which postal orders and cheques in the course of transit by post were pilfered and after various alterations being made therein were encashed at post offices and banks.
The charges inter alia were under sections 467/471 read with section 120 B and a. 420 read with section 120 B of the Indian Penal Code.
The Sessions Judge convicted all the four accused but the High Court maintained the conviction only of the two appellants.
In appeal before this Court the appellants urged that inasmuch as the accused were prosecuted for non cognizable offences under sections 467/471 read with section 120 B I.P.C. the trial was illegal and void as the necessary sanction under section 196 A(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure had not been obtained.
It was further urged that the mere fact that the accused were also tried for the offence of cheating, under section 420 I.P.C. for which no sanction was required, would not make the trial valid.
Under these circumstances it was contended that the joint trial for cognizable and non cognizable offences was illegal and void.
HELD : It is necessary to keep in mind the difference between the object of a conspiracy and the means adopted for realising that object.
No sanction is necessary under section 196 A(2) Cr.
P.C. when the object of the conspiracy is to commit the offence of cheating (420 I.P.C.) but forgery of documents (467 I.P.C.) and similar non cognizable offences are also committed, as merely steps taken, by one or other of the a for the purpose of effecting the main object of the conspiracy.
[533 F H] The object of the conspiracy has to be determined, not only by reference to the sections of the penal enactment, referred to in the charge but on a reading of the charges themselves.
The charges against the appellants showed that the only object of the conspiracy was to cheat the banks or the post offices, referred to in the charges, which is an offence under section 420 read with section 120 B I.P.C. for which no sanction is necessary.
The forging of the documents and usuing such forged documents were only means adopted by the accused for realising the aforesaid object.
Therefore the trial of the accused in the present case for offences under sections 120 B read with sections 467/471 and 420 I.P.C. and other allied offences, cannot be held to be illegal on the ground that sanction under section 196 A(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code had not been obtained.
