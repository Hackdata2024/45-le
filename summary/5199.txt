While dismissing, by its order dated 8 4 71, the writ petition filed by the appellant challenging the findings of the appellate and revisional orders passed by the Collector of Central Excise, Bombay and the Government of India respectively holding that the appellant had been rightly assessed and called upon to pay excise duty in respect of cloth manufactured in some powerlooms and purported to have been purchased by him from the owners of those powerlooms, the Bombay High Court, by its order dated 12th January, 1972 granted certificate of fitness to appeal under Article 133(1)(a) against the said judgment.
Dismissing the appeal, the Court, ^ HELD: 1.
The books of accounts produced by the appellant before the excise authorities contained clear evidence of the fact that the appellant himself was the owner of the yarn alleged to have been sold by Tejpal to the powerloom owners and that the appellant got back that very yarn in the shape of cloth after it was woven into cloth.
Consequently the appellant himself was the manufacturer of the cloth in question and liable to excise duty in respect of the cloth so got manufactured in the powerlooms of private owners.
