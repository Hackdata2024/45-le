Bipat Gope was convicted under sections 323 and 324 read with section 511 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to six months rigorous imprisonment by the High Court on appeal against acquittal, but, was not taken into custody and on the ground of serious illness was kept in the Hospital under Armed Guards.
On application moved by the respondent and on recommendation of the medical authority he was released by the District Magistrate under the jail Manual Rules.
The Appellant contended that his release was conditional under r. 549 of the jail Manual Rules, which was challenged by the respondent.
A nonbailable warrant for arrest was issued against him upon which he moved the High Court under article 226 of the constitution and was directed to appear at the preliminary hearing.
He presented an application before the District Magistrate praying for his appearance and an oppor tunity to present his case before the High Court.
The District Magistrate passed no order but from the respondent 's petition in the High Court, it appeared that Senior Deputy Collector, Patna, ordered his arrest and sent him to jail and his petition in the High Court was withdrawn.
The High Court allowed the respondent 's petition and ordered his release from custody.
The High Court held, that the order of release passed by the District Magistrate was an unconditional release and therefore, he could not be rearrested.
Against that order, State came in appeal by special leave.
The appellant contended that the release must have been under Rule 549 of the jail Manual Rules and not under any other rule.
Held, that the State did not make it clear under which rule he was released and under what lawful authority he was rearrested and thus in absence of such lawful authority, the detention was illegal and the appeal must fail.
