The respondent 's wealth was assessed to Wealth Tax under the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 for three assessment years 1960 61, 1961 62 and 1962 63 the corresponding valuation dates being 31 12 1959, 31 12 1960 and 31 12 1961.
On 14th May, 1953 the assessee wrote a letter to her younger son stating that his late father expressed the wish that he (the second son) should be paid Rs. 50 lakhs out of the family properties and that to keep his promise and also to get peace of mind, if his elder brother did not pay the sum of Rs. 50 lakhs, she would pay such balance that remains unpaid.
The elder brother paid Rs. 20 lakhs.
The balance liability of Rs. 19 lakhs remained due and continued to be due on all the three aforesaid valuation dates.
It was finally wiped off in February, 1962.
On the question "whether, while assessing the net wealth of the respondent within section 2(m) of the Wealth Tax Act, the sum of Rs. 19 lakhs was to be deducted" as debt owed by her, the Wealth Tax Tribunal held in favour of the respondent.
The High Court held that the sum of Rs. 19 lakhs constituted a debt owed by the assessee and was deductible under the Wealth Tax Act from the value of the total assets as on 31 12 1959.
On appeal to this Court, the appellant argued (i) that the letter dated 14 5 1953 created no debt as the undertaking given by the respondent to her son on his elder brother 's failure to pay any portion of the sum was an agreement without consideration and hence it was void and therefore it was not enforceable at law on any of the valuation dates and could not be deducted; (ii) that the undertaking given by the respondent in her letter dated 14 5 1953 was a contingent contract within the meaning of section 31 of the Contract Act.
Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: (1) Taking the totality of facts it was a case of family settlement or family arrangement which was binding on the parties.
The respondent agreed to purchase peace for the family and to pay to her younger son the amount which fell short of Rs. 50 lakhs if her elder son did not pay any portion thereof.
It is well established that such a consideration is good consideration which brings an enforceable agreement between the parties and is not hit by section 25.
Even if it be held that the letter dated 14 5 1953 had not the effect of bringing about the family arrangement or any binding arrangemen bewteen the parties, their subsequent conduct upto 12th September 1959 brought a concluded family arrangement.
The respondent paid Rs. 11 lakhs and reiterated her obligation to pay the balance in the shape of ornaments.
546 That was not honoured by reason of which the younger son had a right to enforce the family arrangement against his mother.
The respondent would have been bound to pay the balance if a suit had been filed against her as he had refrained from going to the law court against his brother on her bringing about the family arrangement.
[548 C G] (2) Assuming that it was a contingent contract within the meaning of section 31 of the Contract act, such a contract under section 32 of the Contract Act, becomes enforceably by law when the future event contemplated in the contingent contract had happened.
The contingency in this case was the liability of the mother to pay a certain sum of money on the failure by the elder son to pay Rs. 50 lakhs or any part thereof.
In that view, the liability of the mother became enforceable by law on the latter date, if not earlier.[548 G H, 549] Kesoram Industries and Cotton Mills Ltd. vs Commissioner of Wealth Tax (Central), Calcutta, 59 I.T.R. 767; Standard Mills Co.
