The appellant was charged with having abetted one R in causing miscarriage to a woman who died in the. attempt.
R was acquitted but the appellant was convicted of the offence of abetting the deceased woman in the commission of the offence.
The High Court confirmed the conviction.
In appeal to this Court, HELD: The facts of the present case fell within the rule that a charge of abetment fails ordinarily when the substantive offence is not established against the principal offender.
The High Court erred in holding that the rule laid down in Gallu Sah vs The State of Bihar, [1959] S.C.R. 861, applied to the facts of the case.
That was an exceptional case; [693 B D] Faguna Kanta Nath vs State of Assam, [1959] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 1, followed.
Umadasi Dasi vs Emperor, I.L.R. approved.
Further, the appellant cross examined ' the prosecution witnesses only 10 show that he had nothing to do with his co accused R, as he was not aware of .the fact that he would be required to show that he did not in any manner abet the deceased.
Therefore, he was prejudiced by the absence of the charge of abetting the deceased woman and hence, was entitled to an acquittal.
[693 A B] Willie Slaney vs The State of M.P., [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1140, referred to.
