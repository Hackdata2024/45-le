Appellants (A1 to A3) were tried for the offences under Sections 147, 148, 323 and 309 read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code.
The Trial Court acquitted A 7 of all the charges but convicted A 1 to A 6 under sections 148 and 302 read with section 149 and sentenced them to imprisonment for life.
On appeal the High Court acquitted A 4 to A 6 but confirmed the conviction and sentence of the appellants.
In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants that in view of the acquittal of four ac cused, the appellant 's conviction under section 148 and on applying section 149 cannot be sustained.
The appellants being three in number could not have formed unlaWful assem bly under section 141 IPC.
Disposing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1.
The High Court erred in confirming the convic tion and sentence of the appellants under Section 148 and on applying 149 I.P.C. on the ground that they formed an unlaw ful assembly alongwith some unidentified persons.
The prose cution case was that the seven named accused formed the unlawful assembly and not that apart from the seven accused persons there were some other unidentified persons who were involved in the crime.
Four accused having been acquitted there was no question of the remaining three appellants forming an unlawful assembly within the meaning of section 141 of the Indian Penal Code.
Accordingly the appellants cannot be convicted under section 148 and an applying 149 I.P.C. Their conviction under the said sections is set aside.
[6F G] 5 2.
Both sections 149 and 34 I.P.C. deal with a combina tion of persons who become liable to be punished as sharers in the commission of offences.
The non applicability of Section 149 I.P.C. is, therefore, no bar in convicting the accused under Section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. if the evidence discloses commission of offence in furtherance of the common intention of them all.
[6H, 7 A] 2.1 Keeping in view the manner of attack and the number and nature of injuries there is no hesitation in holding that the appellants acted in furtherance of their common intention, made the murderous attack on the deceased and caused his instantaneous death.
Therefore, they are held guilty under Section 302 read with Section 34 I.P.C. and are sentenced to life imprisonment.
