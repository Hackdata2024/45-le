The petitioners challenged the validity of the orders issued by the State of Mysore under article 13(4) of the Constitution on July 10, 1961, and July 31, 1962.
The petitioners contended that they had applied for admission to the Pre Professional Class in Medicine in the Karnatak Medical College, Hubli and they would have secured admission to the said medical college but for the reservation directed to be made by the orders mentioned above.
They contended that the above mentioned orders were ultra vires.
They prayed for an appropriate writ or order restraining the respondents from giving effect to those orders and requiring them to deal with their applications for admission on merits.
Held, that the petitioners were entitled to an appropriate writ or order as claimed by them and the respondents were restrained from giving effect to the above mentioned orders.
M. R. Balaji vs State of Mysore [1963] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 439, followed.
The impugned orders we quashed only with reference to the additional reservation made in favour of the socially and 476 educationally backward classes and so the respondents were at liberty to give effect to the reservation made in favour of the ' Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, which was not challenged at all.
The said reservation continues to be operative.
