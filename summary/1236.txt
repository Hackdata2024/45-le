The respondent imported goods of higher value than what was granted under his licence.
The Collector of Customs ordered the goods to be confiscated under section 167(8) of the and in lieu of confiscation gave an option to the respondent to a fine.
On appeal the Central Board of Revenue set aside the order of the Collector of Customs and instead of it imposed a penalty.
The respondent did not pay the penalty and the Collector of Customs took proceedings under section 193 of the Act for the recovery of the penalty in pursuance of which a Magistrate issued warrants of attachment against the respondent holding that the Collector of Customs could validly realise the penalty under section 193 of the Act.
The Sessions Judge dismissed the respondents application in revision but the High Court held that as the penalty was imposed by the Central Board of Revenue the Collector of Customs could not realise the amount of the penalty under section 193 of the Act and also held that the order of the Central Board of Revenue commuting the confiscation to penalty was not without jurisdiction.
On appeal by special leave, Held, that the Central Board of Revenue which is the "Chief Customs Authority" cannot be called an "officer of Customs", and the order of the Chief Customs Authority imposing a penalty for the first time cannot be treated to be an order of the Collector of Customs within the meaning of section 193 of the Sea Customs Act, 1873, and as such the Collector of Customs could not realise the penalty imposed by the Central Board of Revenue.
