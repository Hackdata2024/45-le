The respondent factory used to purchase raw tobacco and after processing it, sell it as chewing tobacco.
Excise duty was paid by the factory in respect of raw tobacco purchased by it.
In sales tax proceedings the factory contended that the excise duty so paid to the Central Government must be deducted to arrive at the net turnover under r. 5(1)i) of the Madras General Sales Tax (Turnover and Assessment) Rules, 1939.
The assessing officer as well as the Appellate Assistant Commissioner rejected the contention but it was accepted by the Tribunal.
The revision filed by the.
State in the High Court was dismissed, whereupon the State appealed to this Court by special leave.
It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the raw tobacco was converted by a manufacturing process into chewing tobacco, a different commodity and that, therefore, under r. 5(1)(i) of the Rules, as excise duty was paid only in respect of raw tobacco and not chewing tobacco the said duty was not deductible from the turnover of the assesses.
HELD : 'Me object of the concession in r. 5(1)(i) is presumably to avoid payment of tax on tax in respect of the same goods.
This concession would have no relevance if the goods subjected to excise duty were different from the goods sold.
Tobacco when converted by a process of manufacture into chewing tobacco becomes a different marketable product.
Duty on raw tobacco cannot therefore be said to be paid in respect of the manufactured product.
[82 B D] The expression "in respect of the goods" in r. 5(1)(i) means only on the goods", and cannot take in the raw material out of which the goods were made.
[83 E] Inland Revenue Commissioners vs Court & Co. [1963] 2 All.
E.R. 722 and Asher vs Seaford Court Estates Ltd., L.R. , considered.
The excise duty paid by the respondent was only on the raw tobacco and not on the goods sold by it, and therefore, the said duty could not be deducted from its turnover under r. 5(1) (i).
