The appellant was convicted of the offence under section 366A read with section 109 of the Indian Penal Code.
The case against him was that A who was a minor below the age of 18 years was brought up by P and had before the date of the offence been habituated to the life of a prostitute.
On the day in question the appellant went to the residence of P and asked him to bring A to a theatre, P accompanied A to the 397 theatre where the latter sought some customers.
They were taken by another person to a place called Bohori Kathada at which place A was invited for the purpose of prostitution.
When P accompanied A to the theatre and from there to Bohori Kathada he knew that she was going for plying her profession as a prostitute.
Held, that the appellant could not in law be held guilty of abetting the commission of an offence under section 366A of the Indian Penal Code by P. A person who merely accompanies a woman going out to ply her profession of a prostitute, even if she has not attained the age of 18 years, could not be said thereby to induce her to go from any place or to do any act with the intent or knowledge that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse within the meaning of section 366 A. Seduction implies surrender of her body by a woman who is otherwise reluctant or unwilling to submit herself to illicit intercourse whether such surrender is for the first time or is preceded by similar surrender on earlier occasions ; but where a person in the course of her profession as a prostitute offers herself for profession as a prostitute offers herself for intercourse, there are no sucruples nor reluctance to be overcome, and surrender by her is not seduction within the Code.
