The first respondent, Municipal Corporation of Delhi, put up an advertisement in the press on 30 12 1978 for filling up 8 posts of Assistant Engineers (Civil) by direct recruitment.
Pursuant to the interviews held in this behalf a list of selected candidates out of Graduate Junior Engineers was prepared and approved on 2.5.1979.
The list was pending final decision about the appointment of the direct recruits selected for these 8 posts.
By its office order dated 10.4.1978 the first respondent entrusted 6 diploma holders Junior Engineers with current duty charge of the posts of Assistant Engineers and by office order dated 21.6.1979 promoted two diploma holder Junior Engineers as Assistant Engineers on current duty charge.
Feeling that the proposed direct recruitment would be detrimental to their interest, the petitioners, who were diploma holder Junior Engineers of the first respondent, filed writ petition No. 221 of 1979 under article 32 of the Constitution, praying for directions to be issued to the first respondent to restrain the first respondent from recruiting Assistant Engineers directly; to give effect to the recommendations of the Third Pay Commission regarding the rules and policy of promotion etc; to reckon the seniority of the petitioners with their length of service and not to affect in any manner all those holding adhoc charge and current duty charge.
The petitioners also prayed for quashing the seniority list dated 2.9.1978 (Annexure G in writ petition 1194 of 1979), The petitioners contended that the first respondent should have suspended the direct recruitment of Assistant Engineers and that the rule prescribing a quota of 50 per cent by promotion and 50 per cent by direct recruitment laid down in the recruitment regulations dated 27.6.1970 should not be followed.
The petitioners submitted that the first respondent Corporation had been following the pattern of functioning current in the Central Public Works Department (C.P.W.D.) in all matters of recruitment, promotion and other conditions.
The C.P.W.D. had decided in August, 373 1975 to suspend direct recruitment in Central Engineering Service w.e.f. 1.4.1972.
The first respondent had taken a decision by passing resolutions in 1970 and 1971 to the effect that all fundamental rules and supplementary rules including amendments and orders issued by the Central Government shall be treated as rules etc.
issued by respondent I. The Central Government had power of general superintendence over the first respondent and it had informed the first respondent by letter dated 23.2.1976 that consequent upon recommendations of the Third Pay Commission direct recruitment may be banned by respondent I as had been done by the C.P.W.D.
The 27th respondent in writ petition 1194 of 1979 contended that since there were only 60 posts of Civil Engineers when the Recruitment Regulations dated 27.6.1970 were made those Regulations could apply only to 60 posts of Assistant Engineers and direct recruits would be entitled to only 30 posts and they were not entitled to further posts by direct recruitment now as they had already been given 36 posts.
The graduate Junior Engineers whose names were on the select list, along with others, filed writ petition No. 1194 of 1979 under article 32 of the Constitution praying for directions to be issued to the first respondent to fill up 8 posts of Assistant Engineers from amongst those in the Select Panel; to fill up the remaining posts of Assistant Engineers in the direct recruitment quota from amongst the empanelled petitioners; to grant revised pay scale of Rs. 550 900 to the petitioners and other Graduate Junior Engineers w.e.f.
the date it was made applicable in the C.P.W.D.; to revise special pay from Rs. 40 to Rs. 75 per mensem w.e.f. 1.1.1979.
The petitioners also prayed for quashing office orders dated 10.4.1978 and 21.6.1979; declaring the Graduate Junior Engineers as a separate category and giving them equal quota under the departmental promotee quota in the posts of Assistant Engineers; and also declaring that the Graduate Junior Engineers in the service of respondent I are entitled to be put on par with their counterparts in other Government Departments.
The petitioners urged that even though a statutory duty was cast on the first respondent to fill up the posts of Assistant Engineers on 50:50 basis, 26 posts of Assistant Engineers in the direct recruitment quota were kept unfilled and only 8 posts were advertised.
The respondent I had not filled up even those 8 posts with candidates from the select list but had in violation of the rights of the petitioners guaranteed under article 16 of the Constitution promoted Junior Engineers with diploma on current duty charge.
Under the Central Civil Service Rules, 1973 and on the basis of the Third Pay Commission 's report the petitioners who were graduate Junior Engineers were entitled to the pay scale of Rs. 550 900.
The petitioners submitted that since they were similarly circumstanced with those other graduate Engineers in class 3 service in other Government departments there was no just or valid reason to discriminate the petitioners qua the other graduate Junior Engineers in class 3 service in other Government departments.
Dismissing writ petition 221 and partly allowing writ petition 1194, ^ HELD: There is nothing wrong in the respondent 1 Corporation proceeding to appoint Assistant Engineers (Civil) by direct recruitment as per the Recruitment Regulations or in fixing the 50:50 quota [and working it out or in the selection of the petitioners in Writ Petition 1194 of 1979 as Assistant 374 Engineers pursuant to the decision to appoint 8 Assistant Engineers (Civil) by direct recruitment.
[403 D H] The Municipal Corporation of Delhi which is a statutory authority is not automatically bound by any decision that may be taken by the C.P.W.D. in regard to direct recruitment of Assistant Engineers and it is open to the Corporation to adopt any policy of the C.P.W.D. by a resolution when alone that policy will become binding on the Corporation.
No provision in the Third Pay Commission 's Report has been brought to the notice of the Court.
On the other hand it is admitted that there is no resolution of the Delhi Municipal Corporation banning or suspending direct recruitment of Assistant Engineers for 7 years or any period from any date whatsoever.
The Central Government 's letter dated 23.2.1976 does not contain any direction which could be issued by the Central Government under sec.
487 of the Act and is not binding on respondent I.
The 50:50 quota fixed in the Recruitment Regulations approved on 27.6.1970 has not been altered but has been approved by the Corporation in its Resolution No. 348 dated 10.7.1978.
[400 C F] A.K. Subbaraman & Ors.
vs Union of India, (1975) 2 S.C.R. 979 referred to.
Respondent I is admittedly bound by the Recruitment Regulations made with the approval of the Central Government as required by sec.
480(2) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act and it shall fill the remaining posts of Assistant Engineers in the direct recruitment quota which are kept vacant in the seniority list dated 2.9.1978 and any further posts which might have become available thereafter or become available in view of the decision in these two Writ Petitions or otherwise in accordance with those Recruitment Regulations.
[403 H, 404 A B] The quota fixed in the Recruitment Regulations cannot be restricted to only 60 posts of Assistant Engineers which were in existence on the date of their approval.
The Recruitment Regulations themselves do not say that they are retrospective in operation from 1958.
Prima facie those Regulations would apply to all future recruitments and promotions.
That is how they have been understood by the authorities of respondent I Corporation when they decided to have 8 posts of Assistant Engineers filled up by direct recruitment though at that time there were 36 directly recruited Assistant Engineers holding more than 50 per cent of 60 such posts.
[400 H, 401 A B] The seniority list dated 2.9.1978 (Annexure G in Writ Petition 1194 of 1979) which was prepared after hearing all concerned does not appear to have been objected to before or after it was finalised except in Writ Petition 221 of 1979.
In that seniority list 130 posts of Assistant Engineers are mentioned by placing one promotee and one direct recruit alternatively according to their seniority.
The petitioners in Writ Petition 221 of 1979 are only Junior Engineers whereas the seniority list relates to Assistant Engineers.
It is not the case of the petitioners in Writ Petition 221 of 1979 that their seniority as Junior Engineers has not been fixed properly.
They are only Junior Engi 375 neers and consequently they cannot question the correctness of the seniority list dated 2.9.1978 relating to Assistant Engineers.
As they have not yet been regularly appointed or promoted as Assistant Engineers they cannot have any grievance about their names not being mentioned in that seniority list.
Therefore, there is no need to quash the seniority list dated 2 9 1978 or to give any direction to respondent I to reckon the seniority of the petitioners with the length of their services.
[401 C E, 410 H, 411 A B] Continuing Current Duty Charge and Adhoc appointments for period exceeding the period of one year mentioned in the memorandum dated 30.12.1976 of the Government of India is irregular though that Memorandum could not be stated to be automatically binding on respondent I.
What is totally wrong is that appointment of Junior Engineers on Current Duty Charge as Assistant Engineers has been made by the impugned order dated 21.6.1979 even after the approval of the select list prepared for the appointment of 8 Assistant Engineers without issuing orders for appointment even to 8 out of those persons who are in the select list.
The appointment of 6 Diploma Holder Junior Engineers by the order dated 10.4.1978 (Annexure I) and of 2 such Junior Engineers by the order 21.6.1979 (Annexure M) as Junior Engineers on Current Duty Charge for periods which are proved to be too long is irregular and the same is quashed.
Respondent I shall issue orders of appointment to 8 Degree holder Junior Engineers out of those in the select list approved on 2.5.1979 within one month from this date and complete the appointment of Assistant Engineers for the remaining posts on regular basis in accordance with the quota fixed in the Recruitment Regulations within six months from this date until which time the Current Duty Charge holder and Adhoc appointees according to seniority will continue to man the remaining posts.
Respondent I shall not make Current Duty Charge/Adhoc appointments and promotions except strictly and truly in accordance with the instructions and Regulations and other instructions, if any, issued in that regard.
[408 H, 409 A E] Declaring the petitioners Graduate Engineers as a separate category amongst Junior Engineers and giving them equal quota like the Diploma holder Junior Engineers out of the 50 per cent for promotion as Assistant Engineers, cannot be done except by carving out two classes in the same category of Junior Engineers on the basis merely of their qualification which is not permissible in law though the creation of selection grade in the same category on the basis of merit and seniority is well known and permissible.
The Junior Engineers do the same kind of work and bear the same responsibilities whatever their qualification, whether they are degree holders or diploma holders.
[411 C E] section B. Patwardhan vs Maharashtra, ; referred to.
The petitioners in Writ Petition 1194 of 1979 cannot be allowed to blow hot and cold.
In regard to the policy of suspension of direct recruitment of Assistant Engineers (for 7 years w.e.f. 1.4.1972) their contention is that the policy of the C.P.W.D. cannot apply automatically to the Corporation until it is adopted by a resolution.
Now in regard to the planning allowance they 376 cannot be heard to say that the revision should be made automatically from 1.1.1979 following the C.P.W.D. pattern.
Evidently, the Corporation has resolved to grant the upward revision only from 19.5.80.
The petitioners are not entitled to claim the revision from 1.1.1979 itself and they have to be satisfied with the revision effected from 19.5.80.
