Although under section 421 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (which is section 384 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973) the High Court has the undoubted power to summarily dismiss a first appeal against conviction of an accused yet in very serious cases like those under section 302 Indian Penal Code, or other cases where death or life imprisonment can be awarded, the High Court should consider the appeal on merits instead of dismissing it summarily, unless the evidence is so clear and cogent, reliable and creditworthy that on the face of it no case for the barest consideration is made out.
Even if the High Court chooses to dismiss the appeal summarily some brief reasons should be given so as to enable the Supreme Court to judge whether or not the case requires any further examination.
If no reasons are given then the task of the Supreme Court becomes onerous in as much as the Judges have to perform the function of the High Court itself by reappraising the entire evidence resulting in serious harassment and expense to the accused.
