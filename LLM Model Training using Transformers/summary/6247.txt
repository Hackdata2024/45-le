The criminal complaint instituted by the appellant was taken cognizance of by the Magistrate for offences under sections 494, 496,498 A, 112, 114, 120, 120 B and 34 IPC.
It was alleged that the first respondent had married the second respondent while the proceedings for decree of divorce were still pending, and that the marriage was performed secretly in the presence of respondent Nos. 3 to 6.
The High Court, however, on the application of the first respondent quashed the proceedings before the Magistrate.
Allowing the appeal by special leave, HELD: The High Court was in error in assessing the material before it and concluding that the complaint cannot be proceeded with.
[167C D] In proceedings instituted on complaint exercise of the inherent power under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Proce dure by the High Court to quash the proceedings is called for only in cases where the complaint does not disclose any offence or is frivolous, vexatious or oppressive.
It is not necessary that there should be a meticulous analysis of the case, before the trial to find out whether the case would end in conviction or not.
The complaint has to be read as a whole.
[166G; 167A] In the instant case, there were specific allegations in the complaint disclosing the ingredients of the offence taken cognizance of.
It was for the complainant to substan tiate the allegations by evidence at a later stage.
In the absence of circumstances to hold prima facie that the com plaint was frivolous there was no jurisdiction for the High Court to interfere.
