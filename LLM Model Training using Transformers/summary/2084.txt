The respondent was assessed to sales tax and was served with a notice requiring him to pay the amount within 21 days.
He preferred an appeal against the order of assessment but did not pay the tax, nor did he obtain an order of stay of proceedings from teh appellate authority.
While the appeal was pending a complaint was filed against him under section 29(1)(d) of the Mysore Sales tax Act, 1957, because the demand was not complied with, but the trial court and the High Court acquitted In appeal to this Court by the State, HELD: The acquittal of the respondent was unwarranted as his action in not paying the tax within the time allowed, was deliberate and therefore wilful and such failure to pay is rendered an offence under section 29(1)(d).
[814 D, E] The liability to pay tax is created by the order of assessment.
Where the tax so assessed is not paid despite service of notice of demand, the tax may be recovered under section 13(3)(a) as an arrear of land revenue or under section 13 (3) (b) on an application to a magistrate as if it were a fine imposed on the assessee.
Under the proviso to section 13(3), the assessee has been afforded interim protection from action under section 13 (3) (a) or (b), provided he obtains from the appropriate appellate or revisional authority mentioned in the proviso, an order of stat of proceedings.
Merely because an appeal has been preferred, the liability of the assessee to pay the tax cannot be deemed to be suspended under section 20(5).
This provision requires that if the order of such appropriate authority lays down any condition, the proviso requires that the assess must comply with it before he can obtain interim relief.
Apart from these two methods of obtaining interim relief, the proviso to section 13(3) cannot be an answer to a prosecution under section 29(1)(d).
