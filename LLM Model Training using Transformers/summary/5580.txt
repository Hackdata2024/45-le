% Sectlon 5 of the Punjab Borstal Act, 1926 empowers courts to pass a sentence of detention in a Borstal institution in the case of male persons less than twenty one years of age convicted of an offence, in lieu of transportation or rigorous imprisonment.
Section 2(4)(i)(a) of the Act which defines 'offence ' takes in offences other than an offence punishable with death.
In his writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, the petitioner who has been convicted for the offence of murder and sentenced to imprisonment for life claimed benefit of the Punjab Borstal Act relying on Hava Singh vs State of Haryana, AIR 1987 SC 2001.
The State contested his claim Dismissing the writ petition. ^ HELD: l. l The Punjab Borstal Act does not have application to an offence punishable under section 302 I.P.C.[561F G] 1.2 What is excepted in the definition of 'offence ' in section 2(4)(i)(a) of the Act is an offence which is punishable with death.
One of the punishments under section 302 I.P.C. for the offence of murder is death, and.
therefore, the offence of murder would be covered with section 2(4)(i)(a) of the Act and to such a conviction the Punjab Borstal Act would have no application.
[560F G] 1.3 The petitioner is, therefore, not entitled to the benefit of the Punjab Borstal Act as he has been sentenced to imprisonment for life for the offence of murder punishable under section 302 I.P.C. for which the sentence of death is prescribed as an alternate.
[561G] 557 1.4 In Hava Singh 's, case the definition of offence was not placed for consideration before the court and, therefore, the conclusion which has been reached is not correct.
