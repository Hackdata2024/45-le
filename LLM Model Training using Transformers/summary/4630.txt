The petitioner and his two associates were convicted and sentenced under section 302 read with section 34, I.P.C. On appeal, the High Court maintained the conviction of the petitioner but acquitted his associates giving them the benefit of doubt.
The Petitioner applied to this Court for grant of special leave to appeal under article 136 but the same was dismissed.
By this petition under article 32 the petitioner sought issuance of a writ of mandamus directing the State to forbear from giving effect to the judgment and sentence passed by the trial court as also the judgment of the High Court as well as the order passed by this Court dismissing the special leave petition on the ground that his conviction was illegal and therefore his detention in jail was in violation of article 21 read with articles 14 and 19.
Dismissing the petition, ^ HELD: The propriety of asking for a declaration in these proceedings under article 32 that conviction of the petitioner by the High Court for an offence punishable under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. is illegal, particularly when this Court has declined to grant special leave under article 136 cannot be appreciated.
Nor can the petitioner be heard to say that his detention in jail amounts to deprivation of the fundamental right to life and liberty without following the procedure established by law in violation of article 21 read with articles 14 and 19.
When a special leave petition is assigned to the learned judges sitting in a Bench, they constitute the Supreme Court and there is a finality to their judgment which cannot be upset in these proceedings under article 32.
Obviously, the Supreme Court cannot issue a writ, direction or order to itself in respect of any judicial proceedings and the learned judges constituting the Bench are not amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court.
