A show cause notice dated 29.1.1976 issued by the re spondent to the appellant calling upon him to explain as to why excise duty treating his product as "fabric" and not as "yarn" may not be levied, was challenged in the High Court of Karnataka in Writ Petition No. 2632/ 1976.
Pending final disposal of the writ petition, an interim order staying the collection of excise duty as a "fabric" for the period 1.4.1975 to 18.8.75 alone was passed with a specific direc tion that the appellant should continue to pay excise duty as "yarn".
Finally the writ petition was dismissed on 16.2.1981.
On 20th May, 1982, another notice No. 913 to show cause was issued to the appellant simultaneously seeking to raise a demand for the period from 20.6.1976 to 28.2.1981 apart from for the period between 1.4.1975 to 18.8.1975 challenged in the earlier writ petition.
The Karnataka High Court having rejected the plea of bar of limitation under section 11A of the raised in the writ petition challenging the said second show cause notice and demand, the appellant has come in appeal by way of special leave.
Allowing the appeal, the Court, HELD: 1.1 Section 3 of the Act which contains the charg ing provision clearly shows that levy and collection are two distinct and separate steps.
[312H] 1.2 The provision of section 11A(1) and (2) of the make it clear that the statutory scheme is that in the situations covered by the sub section(1), a notice of show cause has to be issued and sub section(2) requires that the cause shown by way of representation has to be considered by the prescribed au thority and then 310 only the amount has to be determined.
The scheme is in consonance with the rules of natural justice.
An opportunity to be heard is intended to be afforded to the person who is likely to be prejudiced when the order is made, before making the order thereof.
Notice is thus a condition prece dent to a demand under sub section(2).
In the instant case, compliance with this statutory requirement has not been made, and, therefore, the demand is In contravention of the statutory provision.
[313E G] 2.
Explanation to section 11A of the , which incorporates a well known principle of law, in clear terms refers to 'stay of service of notice '.
The High Court order did not at all refer to service of notice.
The High Court having directed stay of collection of duty as 'fabric ' has not issued any interim direction in the matter of issue of notice of levy of the duty.
Therefore, the benefit of Explanation to section 11A of the Act is not available to the Respondent.
