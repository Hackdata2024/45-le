The proprietary interest of the respondent in his village was abolished by the M. P. Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950, and all rights, title and interest were vested in the State by section 4.
Section 5(a) of the Act provide that where any "buildings" belonging to the proprietor exist on any portion of the abadi land, that land together with the land appurtenant to those buildings shall be settled with the ex proprietor.
Land covered by ottas and chabutras on which sheds had been constructed was settled with the respondent but not the land on which open uncovered ottas and chabutras existed.
Held, that the respondent was entitled under section 5(a) of the Act to have the land on which uncovered ottas an chabutras existed, as also the land appurtenant thereto, settled with him.
Uncovered ottas and chabutras fell within the term "buildings" as used in section 5(a).
The provisions showed that where the proprietor had spent money on constructing something on an abadi site within the limits of the village sites, that site had to be settled with him.
Accordingly the word "buildings" has to be given its literal meaning as something which is built.
