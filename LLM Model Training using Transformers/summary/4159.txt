The appellant was convicted and sentenced to two years ' imprisonment and fine of Rs. 2,000 and imprisonment for six months and fine of Rs. 500 for car lifting and scooter poaching.
On the question of sentence.
Allowing the appeals, ^ HELD : (a) The sentence of imprisonment is reduced to the extent of the period already undergone; but the sentences of fine and the alternative period of imprisonment in case of default are maintained.
[865 H] (b) The long protracted litigation from 1971 onwards is some deterrent for a young man in his 20s.
The youthful age of the offender is a factor which deserve consideration.
A long period of incarceration may brutalise a boy and blunt his finer sensibilities so that the incarceration may perhaps be more criminal than the one at the point of entry.
The offender having served a term of nearly six months must have realised that the game of crime does not pay.
[864 D, 865 C] (c) Payment of fine brings home the sense of responsibility in a surer fashion than even short terms of imprisonment in some cases.
