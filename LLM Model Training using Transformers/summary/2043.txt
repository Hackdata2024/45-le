The State of Bombay by a notification under the Bombay Relief Undertakings (Special Provisions) Act 1958 declared a Mill a 'relief undertaking ' and exempted it from the applicability of section 16 of the C.P. and Berar Industrial Dispute& Settlement Act, 1947.
During the period the exemption was in force, the appellants employees of the Mill abstained from work and were dismissed for joining an illegal strike.
After the exemption was withdrawn and was no longer in operation, the employees filed applications before the Labour Commissioner claiming reinstatement with back wages.
The Labour Commissioner allowed the applications.
The Mill preferred revisions to the Industrial Court which were allowed.
In writ petitions filed by the employees, the High Court confirmed the finding of the Industrial Court, that the employees had no right to file applications under section 16 and the applications filed by them before the Labour Commissioner were not maintainable.
In appeal to this Court.
HELD : The High Court was in error in holding that the applications were not maintainable.
The right of an employee to claim reinstatement on a wrongful dismissal existed de hors section 16 of the Central Provinces and Berar Industrial Disputes Settlement Act.
Section 16 provides a forum for a dismissed employee to claim reinstatement but does not create a right.
The effect of an exemption granted by the notification issued under the Bombay Relief Undertakings (Special Provisions) Act, is not to destroy the right but to suspend the remedy prescribed by section 16 for enforcing that right during the period when the exemption remains in force.
The right can be enforced by a dismissed employee by restoring to the provisions of section 16 of the Act provided he makes the application within six months from the date of his dismissal.
