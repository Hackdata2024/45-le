Appellant plaintfull in the pre emption suit against the respondent (vendee) and Respondent 2 (Vendor) got a decree.
As per the Trial Court decree the appellant deposited a sum of Rs. 15,500 as the price of the land and RB.
100 u tho charges on account of registration and other expenses of the dead.
Respondent I (vendee) filed an appeal and the Additional District Judge dismissed the appeal with the modification directing the appellant to deposit a sum of Rs. 1836 25 more in the trial Court for payment to the vendee, within 15.4.1967; in case of failure the suit was directed to be dismissed.
On 14.4.1967, the appellant deposited Rs. 1836.00 instead of Rs. 1836 25.
He, however, made good the short deposit of 25 Paise on 28.10.1968 with the permission of the Court averring that the omission to deposit 25 paise was due to bona fide mistakes.
The vendee held a regular second appeal and the High Court while dismissing the appeal directed the appellant to deposit within three Months ' time, a further sum of Rs. 500 for the improvements made to the land.
The appellant deposited this sum within the time limit.
In the execution case filed before the executing court, the respondent vendee Sled an application under order XX Rule 14(1)(b), raising an objection to the maintainability of the Execution Petition on the plea that short deposit of 25 Paise within 15.4.1967 amounted to deemed dismissal of the suit itself and that the default could not be condoned.
The executing court by its order dt.
1.2.1969 overruled the objections.
The Judgment debtor 's appeal before the II Additional District Judge was accepted holding that the provisions of order XX Rule 14(1)(b) C.P.C. were mandatory, the short deposit was not due to bona fide mistake and the default could not be condoned.
The appellant preferred a second execution appeal before the High Court, without a certified copy of the order of the executing Court, but with an application for exemption from filing the certified copy.
The appellant was directed on 25.11.1969 to file the 845 certified copy "as soon as is available".
Tho appellant obtained a certified copy A on June 3, 1970 and filed it in the High Court on July 17, 1970.
The appellant filed r an application on July 17, 1970 under section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of delay.
The preliminary objection raised by the Respondent No. 1 that the appeal was barred by limitation, was accepted by the learned single Judge and the Execution second appeal thus stood dismissed.
Hence the appeal after obtaining special leave of the Court.
Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: 1.
The High Court committed an error in not adverting to and not exercising its powers under Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure and in dismissing the appeal without going into the merit of the matter.
Under section 148 C.P.C., the Court has enough power to enlarge time from time to time.
The power given to the Court under section 148, is discretionary and is given for the purpose of securing the ends of justice in case of necessity.
[848 C D, E F, 850 B] 2.
Under order XX, rule 14 C.P.C. the plaintiff decree holder, in order to get delivery of possession of the land, has to fulfill two conditions : (i) he has to deposit in the court the purchase money together with the cost, if any decreed against him, and (ii) the deposit must be made on or before the date fixed by the Court.
[849 E F] However, in view of the deposit of 25 Paise having been made, under the orders of the court after the acceptance of the bona fide mistake, the finding of the first executing appellate court that the non deposit could not be due to any bona fide mistake is absolutely untenable for the reason that while the appellant has deposited in total Rs. 17,936.00 from time to time as directed by the Courts there was absolutely no reason as to why he would not have deposited 25 paise, unless it was due to a mistake.
Indeed, the appellant is the victim of Courts craze for technicalities of law at the cost of justice.
