The High Court on appeal maintained the conviction but reduced the sentence to 2 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 500/ .
on an appeal by Special leave limited only to the question of sentence.
^ HELD: 1. To adjust the duration of imprisonment to the gravity of a particular offence is not always an easy task.
It is always a matter of judicial discretion subject to any mandatory minimum prescribed by law.
In judging the adequacy of a sentence, the nature of the offence, the circumstances of its commission, the age and character of the offender, injury to individuals or to Society, effect of the punishment on the offender, eye to correction or reformation of the offender, are some amongst many other factors which would be ordinarily taken into consideration by courts.
[713GH, 714 FG] 2.
Trial Courts in this country already over burdened with work have hardly any time to set apart for sentencing reflection.
In a good system of administration of criminal justice pre sentence investigation may be of great sociological value.
Throughout the world humanitarianism is permeating into penology and the courts are expected to discharge their appropriate roles.
[714 GH] 3.
Without minimising the seriousness of the offence, having regard to the circumstances of the case, the sentence was reduced from 2 years to one year [715 C]
