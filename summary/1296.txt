The question whether a carrier is a common carrier or not has to be decided on its public profession and such profession may be either by public notice or by conduct.
It is immaterial if the carrying is limited to particular goods or particular routes or between specified points.

803 Consequently, where, as in the instant case, the steamer companies, which were by public profession common carriers in the main stream and invariably agreed, when requested, to arranged for carriage of goods by boats from stations situated on its tributary to the steamer station, accepting goods as indiscriminately as in the steamer service, were sued for loss of goods in the tributary and the High Court, while reversing the finding of the trial court as to the negligence of the companies, affirmed its decree against them on the ground that they were common carriers.
Held, that the decision of the High Court was correct and must be affirmed.
There could be no doubt that the service in the tributary was in the nature of a feeder service to the main route and the public profession made in respect of the latter attached to it.
Held, further, that it was of no consequence that the feeder service yielded no profits.
Nor was regularity or otherwise of the feeder service a relevant consideration.
Law does not require that a common carrier must have fixed rate for carriage of all goods and the absence of such fixed rate in the feeder service was wholly immaterial.
