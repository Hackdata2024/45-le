The appellant, who was a returned candidate, filed a recrimination petition in the election petition filed by the first respondent and another.
As a result of the recount to which all the parties had agreed, the High Court declared the first respondent as elected.
Hence this appeal.
Dismissing the appeal.
^ HELD: The case of Jabar Singh vs Genda Lal on which the appellant relies is of no assistance to him because the facts of the present case are clearly distinguishable from that case.
In that case the returned candidate did not recriminate as provided under sec.
97 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
In the instant case, the appellant had admittedly recriminated and in the recrimination petition one of the grounds taken related to the errors committed at the time of the counting of votes of the Ist respondent by the Returning Officer.
The appellant had also agreed to the recounting of the votes secured by all the parties.
