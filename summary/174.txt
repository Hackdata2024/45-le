Before section 149 of the Indian Penal Code can be applied, the court must find with certainty that there were at least live persons sharing the common object.
This does not, however, mean that five persons must always be convicted before section 149 can be applied.
If the judge concludes that five persons were unquestionably present and shared the common object, though the identity of some of them is in doubt, the conviction of the rest would be good; but if this is his conclusion, it behoves him, particularly in a murder case where heavy sentences have been imposed, to say so with certainty.
