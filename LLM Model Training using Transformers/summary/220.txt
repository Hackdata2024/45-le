Held, that the first portion of cl. 25 of the Rajasthan Foodgrains Control Order, 1949, relating to the freezing of stocks of foodgrains is not void under article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution because such freezing of stocks of foodgrains is reasonably related 983 to the object which the Act was intended to achieve, namely to secure the equitable distribution and availability at fair prices and to regulate transport, distribution, disposal and acquisition of an essential commodity such as foodgrains.
Hold, that the last portion of cl. 25 to the effect that " such stocks shall also be liable to be requisitioned or disposed of under orders of the said authority at the rate fixed for purposes of Government procurement ", is void both under article 19(1)(f) and article 31(2) of the Constitution: (i)because the clause places an unreasonable restriction upon the carrying on of trade or business and is thus an infringement of the respondents ' right under article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution; (ii)because the clause by vesting the power in the authority to acquire the stocks at any price fails to fix the amount of compensation or specify the principles on which it is to be determined and leaves it entirely to the discretion of the executive authority to fix any compensation it likes and is thus hit by article 31(2) of the Constitution.
