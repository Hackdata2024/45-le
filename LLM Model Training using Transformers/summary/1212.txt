The petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands (Vidarbha Region and Kutch Area) Act, 1958, which extended the provisions of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands (Amendment) Act, 1956, to Vidarbha and Kutch.
That Act was declared valid by this Court in Sri Ram Narain Medhi vs The State of Bombay, [1950] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 489, and one of the reason , for doing so was that the lands covered by that Act fell within the definition of the word 'estate ' contained in the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879.
The lands in question in the present petitions were situated in Amraoti and Yeotmal and the existing law relating to land tenures in force in that area was the Madha Pradesh Land Revenue Code, 1954.
This Code did not employ the word ,estate ' and it was contended by the petitioners that the impugned Act was not within the protection of article 31A of the Constitution.
Held, that the contention must fail.
Although the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code, 1954, did not employ the word 'estate ', the relevant definition contained in sections 2(17) and 2(18) of impugned Act and sections 2(7), 2(20) of the Code read with sections 145 and I46 thereof leaves no manner of doubt that the lands in the possession of the petitioners were tenures and in substance ,in estate.
Since the petitioners held the lards tinder the State and paid land revenue for them, the lands fell within the class of local equivalents of the word 'estate. ' as contemplated by article 31A(2)(a) of the Constitution.
