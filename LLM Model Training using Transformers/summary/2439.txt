On the question whether the respondent was entitled to claim compensation in respect of items (ii) and (iii) under section 14(1) of the Act, HELD: (i) The first respondent was entitled to enjoy and was enjoying the Gharkhed lands without the liability to pay assessment, but after the Act came into force.
he was to enjoy those very lands with the liability to pay assessment under section 4 of the Act '.
Therefore, his interest in the property was modified to his disadvantage and so, he was entitled to claim compensation.

Since it was also an interest in property which was extinguished on the abolition of the jagir, the first respondent was entitled to claim compensation.
