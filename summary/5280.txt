Between September 1974 and May 1977 the appellant re ceived more than 6 lakh rupees from its customers by issue of debit notes over and above the amounts received under regular invoices for manufacturing aluminium wire rods on job basis on their behalf.
The Excise Authorities issued notice under Rule 10(i)(c) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, to the appellant to show cause why the aforesaid amount called as "handling charges" should not be added to the invoice price and differential duty recovered.
The Assistant Collector confirmed the demand after cause was shown which was upheld by the Appellate Collector and confirmed by the Tribunal.
In the appeal to this Court, on behalf of the appellant it was contended; (1) that on the basis of Rule 6(b)(i) of the Valuation Rules the statutory levy price of aluminium should be adopted as being the price of comparable goods and with effect from 1.10.75 the assessable value should have been fixed under proviso (ii) to s.4(1)(a) or s.4(1)(b) at the same amount,.
(2) that Rs.60 which was collected as handling charges was not to be taken into account for com puting duty and (3) that the notice was barred by limita tion.
Dismissing the appeal, HELD: (1) With effect from 1.10.1975 a new s.4 has been inserted into the Central Excise & Salt Act, 1944 providing for the mode of valuation.
The period involved in this appeal is from 27.9.1974 upto 31.5.1977.
Therefore, the period upto 30.9.1975 would be covered by the old s.4 and from 1.10.1975 till 31.5.1977 the provisions of new section would apply for determining the assessable value.
[320E] 319 (2) As per arrangement between the appellant and its customers, the appellant was permitted to lift the allotted ingots directly and after carrying out the manufacturing process it used to deliver the same to the customers.
[321C D] (3) There has been no sale of the material between the appellant and the customers.
The appellant was collecting Rs.600 per metric ton as conversion charges and Rs.60 per metric ton as handling charges.
[320G] (4) The handling charges were intended to cover the appellant 's expenses in lifting the ingots.
The Tribunal has come to the right conclusion in holding that the handling charges represented pre manufacturing cost and became part of the value for computation of duty.
[321D E] (5) Rule 9 which corresponds to s.11 A of the Act pro vided a period of one year for taking of proceedings while Rule 10 corresponding to the present section 11 of the Act pre scribed a period of three months for such purpose.
With effect from 6.8.1977, the period of six months was substi tuted for the period of three months and the period of five years substituted for the period of one year.
[321B C] (6) The rule is intended to relate back and cover a period of five years from the date jurisdiction under the rule is invoked.
The provision, is therefore, retrospective in operation.
[321G] (7) Once the rule comes into existence and jurisdiction under the rule is invoked, it has got to cover a period upto five years preceding the date of issue of notice.
