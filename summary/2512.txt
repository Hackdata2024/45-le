The respondent 's lorry was used by the driver of the lorry and another, without the respondent 's knowledge, for illicit transport of forest timber worth more than Rs. 50.
The driver and the other person were convicted for offences under sections 35 and 36 of the Andhra Pradesh Forest Act, 1882, and the magistrate directed confiscation of the lorry under section 43 of the Act as amended by Act 11 of 1963.
The Sessions Court set aside the order of confiscation in appeal and the High Court confirmed the order of the Sessions Court.
In appeal to this Court, HELD: The Legislature originally conferred both upon the trial court and the appellate court a discretion to pass an appropriate: order with regard to the disposal of a vehicle used in the commission of an offence under the Act.
After the amendment of 1963, the Legislature made it obligatory upon the trial court to confiscate the vehicle used, but no such restriction was placed upon the appellate court; Under section 47, the appellate court could pass orders regarding disposal of property in the same manner 'as an appellate court under section 520 Criminal Procedure Code, corresponding to section 419 of the Code of 1872.
Under section 520 of the Code, power is conferred upon the appellate court to pass any appropriate order, as may be just, regarding the disposal of property used in the commission of any offence.
The order of the Sessions Court in appeal in the present case was essentially a just order and was rightly confirmed by the High Court.
