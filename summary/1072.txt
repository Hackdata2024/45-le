The question in this appeal was whether the Tribunal was wrong in not allowing the amount paid to a political fund which was permissible as an item of expense and for disallowing the claim for deduction of certain amounts as extraneous income and whether the salesmen and apprentices were entitled to bonus.
168 Held, that though the law or the rules of the company per mitted the employer to pay amounts as donations to political funds, it was not a proper expense to be deducted when working out the available surplus in the light of the Full Bench formula.
Held, further, that neither the profits from transactions which were carried out in the normal course of business, nor the commission earned on transactions entered directly with foreign manufacturers, where the workmen had serviced the goods and did other work which brought such business to the employer, could be allowed as extraneous income.
Held, also that the salesmen who were given commission on sales had already taken a share in the profits of the company on a fair basis and there was no justification for granting them further bonus out of the available surplus of profits.
That the apprentices hardly contributed to the profits of the company.
Thus they were not entitled to any bonus.
