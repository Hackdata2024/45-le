Allowing the petitions, the Court ^ HELD: The supply to the detenus of the grounds of detention in the English language with which they were not conversant could not be considered to be effective communication to them so as to afford to them a real opportunity of making a representation against the order of detention.
Their detention is repugnant to the provisions of Article 22 (5) of the Constitution.
The complicated nature or the length of the document, is not a sine qua non for the fulfilment of the requirement that the grounds must be supplied to the detenu in a language which he understood before the service on him of such grounds could be considered a communication thereof to him.
