By the enactment of Calcutta Tramways Act, 1951, the Government of West Bengal was substituted for the Corporation of Calcutta (Respondent) in various agreements entered into between the predecessors in interest of the appellant and the predecessors in interest of the respondent, subject to a reservation that any sum payable under the agreements shall be payable by the appellant to the respondent.
All the agreements contained an arbitration clause which provided for refering any disputes arising under the agreements to arbitration in the prescribed manner.
Disputes arose as regard the track rent payable by the appellant to the respondent and the dispute was referred to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the arbitration clause.
The appellant nominated its arbitrator without prejudice to its rights, and filed an application in the High Court, for the determination of the question whether there was a valid arbitration agreement between the appellant and respondent.
The High Court held that there was an agreement.
In appeal by special leave: HELD: Both the right to the sums payable to the respondent and the procedure of arbitration were saved under the Act.
The proviso to section 5 of the Act, in terms as well as by necessary implication brings the subject matter of the sums payable under the agreements both under the substantive and procedural aspects within the scope of the exception.
The substantive right to the payment of rent and the procedural one to have any dispute arising in respect of that right referred to arbitration embodied in the agreements are interconnected and are not severable.
To preserve the substantive right and to withhold the procedural right to enforce it is to save the right and deny the remedy.
