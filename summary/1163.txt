The petitioner purchased some land from R. R. was declared to be an intending evacuee and be left for Pakistan.
The Assistant Custodian issued a 'notice to the petitioner to show cause why the land should not be declared to be evacuee property, and after hearing the petitioner he declared the land to be evacuee property.
An appeal and a revision against the order were unsuccessful.
The petitioner also applied to the Custodian under section 40 Of the , for confirmation of the sale but his application was rejected under section 40(4)(a) on the ground that the evacuee did not act in good faith in effecting the sale.
The petitioner contended that section 2(d) of the Act defining evacuee property and section 40(4) empowering the custodian to reject an application for confirmation violated article 31(2) as they enabled the State to take away property without the authority of law.
Held, that the provisions Of SS. 2(d) and 40(4) were not affected by article 31(2) in view of article 31(5)(b)(iii) of the Constitution.
The protection of article 31 (5)(b)(iii) was not limited to a law which itself declared any property to be evacuee property but extended to a law which empowered an authority to declare any property as evacuee property and laid down the criteria for the declaration.
Section 40(4)(a) of the Act which empowered the Custodian to reject an application for confirmation on the ground that the transaction had not been entered into in good faith could not be challenged as conferring arbitrary powers on the Custodian.
The power was in the nature of a judicial power and the absence of a standard for the determination of the question could not render the provision unconstitutional.
