The first respondent on the death of her husband who was a descendant of the famous Vaishnava teacher Vallabhacharyaji and was possessed of certain Devattar properties belong to the Thakur of which be was the Shebait, adopted her sister 's husband as a son under the Goda Dattak Custom of adoption which prevailed amongst the Vallabhacharya community.
The appellant who was the own brother of the deceased adoptive father contended inter alia that under the Goda Dattak custom a widow could not adopt her sister 's husband as a son to her husband, that the adoptee should belong to the family of the adopter and that the widow should obtain the ,consent of her husband 's sapindas for the adoption.
Held, that the rule in Dattaka Mimansa against the adoption of the son of a woman who could not be married because of Viruddha Samandha relationship is recommendatory and even if the limitation of the orthodox Dattak adoption apply to Goda adoption there is no bar to the adoption of the wife 's sister 's husband.
Abhiraj Kuer vs Devendra Singh, C. A. No. 379 of 1961 decided on 15 9 61, referred to.
In the present case it has not been proved that under the Goda Dattak customs a custom existed barring the adoption of members of other Vallabhachari families if it were possible to adopt members from the adoptive father 's family.
As in the present case there was authority from the husband to adopt the question of the consent of the sapindas of the ' husband did not arise even if he was governed by the Madras School of Mitakshara.
