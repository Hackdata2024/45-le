The second respondent sold her house to the appellant.
The first respondent filed a suit for possession of the house on the ground that she had a right of prior purchase under section 15 (fourthly) of the Right of Prior Purchase Act 1993, because, her house and the house in question had a common outer entrance within the meaning of that clause The suit was decreed.
In appeal to this Court it was contended that: (1) On a proper construct ion of the clause such an entrance would not give rise to a right of pre emption unless the owner claiming the right and the owner of the house in question jointly owned the common outer entrance, and, (2) the clause as interpreted by the Courts below violated article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution and was therefore ultra vires.
HELD: (1) The clause provides that where the We is of property having a common outer entrance with other properties, the Tight of prior purchase shall vest in the owners of such properties.
There is nothing in the section to warrant the construction that such a right would vest only if the common outer entrance is jointly owned by the owners of such houses.
[275H] (2) In the case of properties having a common entrance, the owners of the buildings would stand more or less in the position of co sharers and the right of pre emption is sustainable as a reasonable restriction.
