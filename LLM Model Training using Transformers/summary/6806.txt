'P ' executed a will on 22.6.1924.
The terms of the will provided that after the death of testator his wife shall enjoy the properties till her lifetime; after her wife 's lifetime the properties shall be enjoyed absolutely by his daughter and after her daughter the properties should go to her male children.
A question arose as to whether on the basis of the will the daughter acquired a fife estate or an absolute estate.
The High Court held that the fact that the testator directed that after her daughter the properties shall go to her male children clearly showed an intention that daughter 's inter est in the properties was not absolute.
Accordingly, the High Court held that the daughter acquired only a life estate in the properties.
Hence this appeal against the judgment of the High Court.
Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1.
It cannot be held that the,testator of the will wanted to give absolute right in the property to his daugh ter.
The intention of the testator to give absolute right in the property to his daughter is negatived by a clear mention in the will that after his daughter the property shah ulti mately go to her male children.
In case the intention of the testator was to give the properties absolutely in favour of his daughter and not merely life interest then there was no question of mentioning .that after her it should go to her male children.
Accordingly, the view taken by the High Court was correct.
