Accepting the State appeal, negativing the claim for interest and dismissing the original writ petition, the Court, ^ HELD: The expression "would not make any further claim in regard to compensation" in the agreement dated the 24th February, 1969 was clearly used by the petitioners respondents not in the sense in which it is used in sections 23 and 34 of the Land Acquisition Act but more comprehensively Meaning reimbursement in full satisfaction of their claim in respect of the acquisition.
The condition attached by them to the relinquishment of their claim was that the agreed amount must be paid to them before 31st March 1969, which agreement would show that by the acceptance of the quantified sum of Rs. 4,41,202.45 they condoned the delay in payment and also relinquished all future claims to interest.
If it were otherwise, the respondents would have expressly reserved their right to claim interest under section 34 of the Act.
