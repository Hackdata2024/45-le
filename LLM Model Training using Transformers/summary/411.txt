Section 18 of the Court of Wards Act, 1879, provides that the Court of Wards "may sanction the giving of leases or farms of the whole or part of any property under its charge, and may direct the mortgage or sale of any part of such property, and may direct the doing of all such other acts as it may judge to be most for the benefit of the property and the advantage of the ward".
In exercise of the power conferred by this section the Court of Wards sanctioned a deed of prospecting license in favour of B, the predecessor in interest of the appellant, and the same was executed on 26 3 1915.
Subsequently, on 23 11 1917 the manager of the Court of Wards executed a deed modifying the terms of the deed dated 26 3 1915, by virtue of which the period of license could be extended up to 26 3 1951 under certain conditions.
On 10 8 1937 the respondent having become major assumed management of the estate and thereafter repudiated the aforesaid deeds and contested their validity on the grounds, inter alia, (1) that the deed dated 26 3 1915 was not for the benefit of the ward as the clause therein relating to the payment of the cess was less advantageous to him than the corresponding clause in the prospecting license executed by the then proprietor of the estate on 26 11 1907 in respect of another property known as the Bokaro license, and that the Court of Wards executed the deed in question without bestowing any thought to it, (2) that the Court of Wards had no power to enter into the transaction dated 23 11 1917 as it had the effect of preventing the ward from dealing with his estate for over a period of 32 years after he attained majority, (3) that in granting the deed dated 23 11 1917 the Court of Wards considered only the benefit of the grantee and not that of the ward and (4) that the deed was void because no sanction had been given to it by the Court of Wards, as required by section 18 of the Court of Wards Act, 1879.
Held, (1) that the Court of Wards is not in the same position as a guardian of the properties of a minor.
It is a statutory body with powers defined by the Court of Wards Act, 1879.
Under section 18 326 of the Act the Court of Wards is given the power to judge for itself whether a transaction entered into by it on behalf of the ward is for the benefit of the property and the advantage of the ward and its act cannot be impugned in a court of law by the ward on attaining majority unless he shows that it did not act bona fide and in the interests of the ward and that its action amounted to a fraud on the power, or that it did not, in fact, apply its mind to the question whether the act was for the benefit of the property or the advantage of theward, and that though it purported to exercise the power unders.
18, it did not, in fact, come to a. judgment as required bythe section.
Its decision cannot be questioned on the ground that it was erroneous on the merits, or that it was reached without considering some aspects which ought to have been considered, unless the failure to consider them was of such a character as to amount to there being no exercise of judgment at all; Allcroft vs Lord Bishop of London: Lighton vs Lord Bishop of London, ([1891] A.C. 666), relied on.
(2)that assuming that the cess clause in the deed dated 26 3 1915 was less advantageous to the ward than that in the Bokaro license, as the Court of Wards had applied its mind to the question and formed its own judgment on it, its decision is not open to question; (3)that the Court of Wards was competent to enter into the transaction dated 23 11 1917 and extend the period of license so as to enure for a period beyond the date of the ward coming of age, as section 18 of the Act which confers authority on the Court of Wards is general and unqualified in terms and there is no provision in the Act such as there is in section 29(b) of the , that a lease by the Court of Wards was to enure for a period related to the minority of the ward; (4)that assuming that the words in section 18 that the act should be "for the benefit of the property and the advantage of the ward" should be read cumulatively and not disjunctively, the deed dated 23 11 1917 satisfies the requirements of the section inasmuch as the benefits which the transaction conferred on the estate in the form of minimum ground rent, salami and royalty must also enure to the advantage of the ward who will be the person who will receive this revenue; (5)that the requirements as to sanction under section 18 of the Act must be held to be satisfied if the transaction in all its essential particulars had been sanctioned by the Court of Wards, even though there were details to be worked out in furtherance of the sanction and the document as finally drafted had not been submitted again for its approval.
A mere recital in the deed that the transaction was sanctioned is not conclusive and it must be shown that, as a matter of fact, sanction was given, and as the order of the Court of Wards dated 9 10 1917 contained the sanction to the proposal in 327 all its essential particulars it was sufficient compliance with the requirements of the section; Gulabsingh vs Seth Gokuldas, (40 I.A. 117) and Ramkanai Singh Deb Darpashaha vs Mathewson, (42 I.A. 97), relied on.
and (6) that section 18 only requires that the transaction should be entered into with the sanction of the Court of Wards and if the transaction subsequently turns out to be bad on the merits, either in part or in toto, it does not render the sanction originally given ineffective.
