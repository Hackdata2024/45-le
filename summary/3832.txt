The appellant was convicted under section 302/34, Indian Penal Code and sentenced.
Statements of two witnesses recorded in the committing court were transferred to the record during trial under section 288 Cr.
P.C. and the trial court treated the evidence of these witnesses as substantive evidence.
The High Court accepted the testimony of the witnesses before the committing Court.
In appeal it was contended that the statements of wit nesses in the committing court transferred under section 288 were inadmissible in evidence and should not be acted upon, since no specific portion of their contradictory statements had been put to them in cross examination.
Dismissing the appeal, HELD: There is no legal infirmity about the transfer of deposition of the witnesses to the record of the Sessions Court under section 288 Cr.
It was a legitimate use of discretion by the Sessions Judge.
Evidence recorded in the committing court is substantive evidence in this case and is admissible.
[147 E F] Section 288 Cr.
P.C. which provides for transfer of evidence recorded in the committing court under certain circumstances is subject inter alia to the provisions of section 145 of the Evidence Act.
Provisions of the latter section have been substantially complied with in this case.
[147 E] In the instant case after drawing the attention of the witnesses to their contradictory statements recorded by the police, the statements recorded by the committing Magistrate were read out to the witnesses who did not deny have made them but only explained that they had deposed in that manner under threat and pressure from the police.
