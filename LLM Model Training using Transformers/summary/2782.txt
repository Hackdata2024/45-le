The assessee, a dealer registered under the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948, filed returns of the turnover of its business for the quarters ending 30th June, 1962 and 30th September, 1962 and the Sales Tax Officer assessed the tax for the two quarters.
On the question whether the tax could be assessed only at the end of the year and not during the year, HELD : Under the Act, sales tax is a yearly tax, but that does not imply that assessment of tax quarterly is illegal if provision is made in the Act for quarterly returns and assessment.
Since the provisions relating to returns and assessment, namely, sections 10 and I 1, and rule 20, contemplate submission of quarterly returns, assessment of tax due thereon and payment of the tax by the taxpayers, the tax was validly assessed.
