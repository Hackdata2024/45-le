The appellant company dismissed some workmen after a domestic enquiry holding them guilty on a charge of 'go slow ' action.
The respondents raised an industrial dispute.
The Industrial Tribunal found that the dismissal of the respondents could not be sustained as there was no specific mention of 'go slow ' in the charge.
Further it found that there was denial of natural justice at the enquiry as the workmen were not allowed to be represented by a person of their choice.
The Tribunal set aside the dismissal of the respondents and ordered their reinstatement.
The company appealed to the Supreme Court by special leave.
HELD : (i) The charge specified cls.
10(vii) and (xvi) of the Operators Standing Orders.
These clauses deal with insubordination and, inter alia, with 'go slow '.
The workmen had been expressly warned by notice that they were "going slow" and in their reply to the charge they denied that they were going slow.
The Tribunal was thus wrong in holding that the workmen were not charged with 'go slow ' action and could not be found guilty of that charge.
[143 B C, G H] (ii) 'Mere was no denial of natural justice because the workmen asked to be represented by a member of a union which was not recognised The Standing Orders clearly provided that only a representative of a union which is registered under the Trade Union Act and recognised by the company can assist. 'Mere was no right to representation as such unless the company by its Standing Order recognised such a right.
