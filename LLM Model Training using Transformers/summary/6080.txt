The appellant company was manufacturing and selling black and galvanised steel tubes and pipes.
In the assess ment proceedings for the years 1982 83 and 1983 84 under the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963 the appellant contended that since the galvanised pipes manufactured by it were "declared goods" they were not liable to additional sales tax as well as surcharge.
Rejecting the contention, the assessing authority taxed the turnover of galvanized iron pipes at four per cent and also assessed an additional tax and surcharge treating the galvanized iron pipes as 'goods ' falling under Entry 46 of the First Schedule to the Kerala Sales Tax Act.
Demands were raised from the Appellant compa ny accordingly.
The Company filed a writ petition in the High Court.
The High Court, held that as a result of the process of galvani sation the galvanised iron pipes had acquired different commercial identity and therefore, could not be identified with steel tubes mentioned in Section 14(iv)(xi) of the .
In these appeals on the question: whether galvanised iron pipes and tubes are a commercially different commodity from steel tubes mentioned in Section 14(iv)(xi) of the .
Allowing the appeals and setting aside the judgment and order of the High Court, this Court, 211 HELD: 1.
Galvanised pipes are steel tubes within the meaning of Section 14(iv)(xi) of the .
The view taken by the High Court to the contrary was errone ous.
[213E] 2.
Galvanisation is done on steel tubes or pipes as a protective measure only, i.e., to make it weather proof.
Merely because the steel tube has been galvanised does not mean that it ceases to be a steel tube.
It still remains a steel tube and neither its structure nor function is al tered.
Galvanisation does not bring a new commodity into existence and as a commercial item it is not different from a steel tube.
