The appellant had been paying puja bonus to its workmen continuously from 1940 to 1952 at the rate of one month 's wages.
From 1948 to 1952, the appellant whenever it paid this bonus, made it clear that it was ex gratia payment and would not constitute any precedent in future years.
The dispute arose regarding the payment of bonus in 1953.
The workmen claimed that the sole object of bonus which had been granted to them upto that year was to meet puja expenses and that the payment of this bonus had become customary and a term of employment.
The appellant contended that payments in the past years had been entirely ex gratia and as there was loss in 1953 no ex gratia payment could be made in that year.
Held, that the workmen were not entitled to puja bonus as an implied term of employment for an implied agreement could not be inferred when the appellant had made it clear that the payments from 1948 to 1952 were ex gratia; but they were entitled to puja bonus on the basis that it was a customary and traditional payment.
In determining whether the payment was customary and traditional the following circumstances have to be established : (i) that the payment has been made over an unbroken series of years ; (ii) that it has been for a sufficiently long period, the period has to be longer than in the case of an implied term of employment; (iii) that it has been paid even in years of loss and did not depend on the earning of profits; and (iv) that the payment has been made at a uniform rate throughout.
The fact that the employer made the payment ex gratia made no difference; nor did unilateral declarations of one party inconsistent with the course of conduct adopted by it matter.
