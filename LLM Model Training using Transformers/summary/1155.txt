The appellants were partners in a registered firm which was dissolved on March 24, 1945.
A private limited company succeeded to the business of the firm from March 25, 1945.
For the accounting period April 1, 1944, to March 24, 1945, the firm was assessed to excess profits tax under the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940.
It had deposited certain sums of money as required under section 10 of the Indian Finance Act, 1942, read with section 2 Of the Excess Profits Tax Ordinance, 1943, and in accordance with those provisions became entitled to repayment of a portion of the excess profits tax.
The appellant 's claim before the Income.
tax Officer under section 25(4) of the 'Indian Income tax Act, 1922, that no tax was payable on the profits of the firm for the period between April 1, 1944, to March 24, 1945, was allowed, but their plea that the amount of refund of the excess profits tax was business profit and therefore similarly exempt from tax, was rejected.
The High Court, on a reference, took the view that the amount refunded was income from other sources taxable under section 12 Of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, and that, therefore, the appellants were not entitled to the benefit of section 25(4) Of that Act.
Held, that in view of section 12(1) of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, and section II(II) of the Indian Finance Act, 1946, the amount refunded was income from business for the purposes of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, and did not lose its character which it had before the deposit.
It fell under section 10 of the Indian Income tax Act and was, therefore, exempt under section 25(4) of that Act.
