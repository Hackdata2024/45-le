By an order dated 31st December, 1968, the sales tax officer found from the turnover of the respondent firm as revealed from the quarterly returns filed by the assessee that is disclosed an assessable income.
He proceeded to make a provisional assessment in respect of the portion of the assessment year 1968 concerned purporting to act under section 7A of ' the U.P. Sales Tax Act.
The respondent challenged the same before the High Court praying that the sales tax officer had no jurisdiction to make a provisional assessment, because the assessee had in fact filed a return.
The High Court of Allahabad accepted the contention and quashed the order of the sales tax officer.
The High Court hold that as conditions mentioned in section 7(3) did not apply to the facts of the case in as much as it was not a case in which the assessee had not filed a return at all, no assessment could have been made by the sales tax officer.
Allowing the appeal by special leave, ^ HELD: Section 7A clearly authorises the assessing authority to make provisional assessment in respect of the assessment year to the best of his judgment, and does not contain any pre conditions at all.
On the other hand it applies the provisions of the Act which includes the provisions of section 7(3) which is the provision that confers power on the assessing authority to make an assessment to the best of his judgment.
It is true that sub rule (3) of rule 41 contains a provision that the provisional assessment to the best of the judgment can be made where no return is submitted, but this rule has to be read as supplemental to the provisions of the parent Act.
What this rule implies is that whether the return is filed by the assessee or not, the assessing authority will have the power to make provisional assessment.
There is no inconsistency between section 7A and rule 41(3) of the Rules framed under the Act.
