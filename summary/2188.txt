The Revenue authorities did not allow depreciation on the cost of land alongwith the cost of building standing thereon.
The Appellate Tribunal accepted the assessee 's appeal and the High Court answered the question in favour of the assessee.
In appeal to this Court by the Revenue: HELD: The appeal must be allowed.
Building under section 10(2), does not include the site because there cannot be any question of destruction of the site.
[183 E] The word used in section 10(2)(vi) is "depreciation" and "depreciation" means "a decrease in value of property through wear, deter oration, or obsolescence, and allowance made for this in book keeping, accountings etc." In that sense land cannot depreciate.
[183 H] By r. 8 of the Indian Income tax Rules the rate of depreciation is fixed on the nature of the structure.
It would be difficult to appreciate why the depreciation of land would be dependant on the class of structures.
[184 D E] The whole object of section 10 is to arrive at the assessable income of a building after allowing necessary expenditure and deductions.
If depreciation on land was allowed it would give a wrong picture of the true income.
[184 F G] Corporation of the City of Victoria and Bishop of Vancover , distinguished.
