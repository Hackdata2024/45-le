The High Court granted certificate for leave to appeal to this Court in a case where it set aside the ex parte decree in the suit and restored the suit to the Me of the trial court.
HELD: The certificate granted by the High Court was premature and was not competent.
As a result of the setting aside of the decree the suit was very much alive, and it could not be treated as a final adjudication of the suit itself.
The Constitution contemplates the filing of an appeal by certificate only against a judgment, decree of final order of the High Court.
It does not contemplate bringing an appeal in a suit which is still a live suit and in which further proceedings are to be taken.
