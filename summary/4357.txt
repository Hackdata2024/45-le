It enjoins upon the Superintendent to give immediate information to the District Magistrate who thereupon has to decide whether investigation of the complaint should be conducted by a police officer or by a Magistrate.
The respondent, a police officer, was convicted of an offence under section 5(1)(d) read with section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and sentenced to suffer imprisonment.
On the ground that there was non compliance with the provisions of Rule 16.38 of the Rules a single Judge of the High Court acquitted the respondent.
Setting aside the order of acquittal and remanding the case to the High Court for fresh disposal in accordance with law. ^ HELD: The High Court was wrong in acquitting the respondent.
[990 D] Rule 16.38 is not designed to be a condition precedent to the launching of a prosecution in a Criminal Court.
It is in the nature of instructions to the department and is not meant to be of the nature of a sanction or permission for a prosecution; nor can it override the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act.
