Being of the opinion that there had been a substantial fall in the volume of production in respect of cotton textiles manufactured in the respondent company, an industrial under taking, for which having regard to the economic conditions prevailing there was no justification, the Central Government made an order under s.15 of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act,, 1951, appointing a committee of three persons for the purpose of making a full and complete investigation into the circumstances of the case.
After the committee made its report,the Central Government being of the opinion thereupon that the company was being managed in a manner highly detrimental to public interest, made an order under section 18 A of the Act authorising the first appellant to take over the management of the whole of the said undertaking.
The respondents challenged the legality of the order on the ground, inter alia, that on the proper construction of s.18.A the Central Government had the right to make the order under that section on the ground 172 that the company was being managed in a manner highly detrimental to public interest only where the investigation made under s.15 was initiated on the basis of the opinion,as mentioned in section 15(b), whereas in the present case, the investigation ordered by the Central Government was initiated on the formation of an opinion as mentioned in cl.
(a) (1) of section 15.
Held, that the order passed by the Central Government under section 18 A was valid and that the words.
used by the legislature in section 18A (1)(b) "in respect of which an investigation has been made under section 15" could not be cut down by the restricting phrase "based on an opinion that the.
industrial undertaking is being managed in a manner highly detrimental to the scheduled industry concerned or to public interest.
" Section 18A (1)(b) empowers the Central Government to authorise a person to take over the management of an industrial undertaking if the one condition of an investigation made under section 15 had been fulfilled irrespective of on what opinion that investigation was initiated, and the further condition is fulfilled that 'the Central Government was of opinion that such undertaking was being managed in a manner highly detrimental to the scheduled industry concerned or to public interest.
