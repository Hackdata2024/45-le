% What fell for consideration in all these matters, viz., (i) SLPs.
(civil) Nos. 4826 and 7045 of 1987, (ii) SLP (civil) No. 5240 of 1987, (iii) C.M.Ps.
Nos. 12029 31/87 (in CAs Nos.
577 79 of 1987), (iv) C.M.Ps.
16635 and 16918/87 (in S.L.P. (c) No. 4826/87) and (v) Transferred Cases Nos. 13 and 14 of 1987 (with CMPs.
16887 89 and 17018/87), was a common question of law whether equity shares in two companies, i.e. 10,00,000 shares in Swadeshi Polytex Ltd. and 17,18,344 shares in Swadeshi Mining and Manufacturing Company Ltd., held by the Swadeshi Cotton Mills, vested in the Central Government under section 3 of the Swadeshi Cotton Mills Company Ltd. (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1986.
The other subsidiary question was whether the immovable properties, namely, bungalow No. 1 and Administrative Block, Civil Lines, Kanpur, had also vested in the government.
There were six original proceedings initiated by various parties which gave rise to these civil appeals, special leave petitions and transferred cases before this Court.
These were: On 18th February, 1987, a suit was filed before the Delhi High Court by one Naresh Kumar Barti against Dr. Raja Ram Jaipuria, Swadeshi Polytex and others, for an injunction restraining the company from holding the 17th annual general meeting on the ground that 34% shares in the Swadeshi Polytex vested in the National Textile Corporation (N.T.C.) in view of sections 3 and 4 of the Act.
In the suit, an application was also filed praying that in the event of the annual general meeting of the company being allowed to be held, an independent Chairman should be appointed to conduct the meeting.
The High Court 963 refused to pass any order (in view of an order already passed by the Allahabad High Court).
Against this order of the Delhi High Court, two special leave petitions were filed in this Court one by Doypack Systems Pvt.
Ltd. (defendant No. 10 in the Delhi Suit), which came to registered as Civil Appeal No. 577 of 1987 after the grant of special leave, and the other, by Naresh Kumar Barti, the plaintiff in the Delhi Suit, which came to be registered as Civil Appeal No. 578 of 1987 after the grant of special leave.
On 24th February, 1987, one Bari Prasad Aggarwal filed a suit in the court of the Third Additional Civil Judge, Kanpur praying inter alia that Shri Raja Ram Jaipuria should not preside over the 17th annual general meeting of the company.
The application for an interim injunction filed in the suit was dismissed.
In the appeal preferred by the plaintiff before the Allahabad High Court, an order was passed by the High Court on 2nd March, 1987, appointing Shri M.P. Wadhawan as the Chairman of the said annual general meeting.
Against this order dated 2nd March, 1987, passed by the Allahabad High Court M/s. Doypack System Pvt. Ltd., preferred a special leave petition in this Court, which after the grant of leave, was registered as Civil Appeal No. 577 of 1987.
The three special leave petitions were heard together as Civil Appeals Nos. 577, 578 and 579 of 1987 and disposed of by this Court by a common order on 6th March, 1987, appointing Shri Jaswant Singh as the Chairman of the said annual general meeting.
On 26th February, 1987, another suit Suit No. 506 of 1987 was filed in the Delhi High Court by Mukesh Bhasin for a declaration that Swadeshi Cotton and Swadeshi Mining had no right in respect of 34% of the share holdings in Swadeshi Polytex and that the said shares were vested in the N.T.C. by virtue of the said Act.
By order dated 9th March, 1987, the High Court disposed of that application and granted injunction restraining defendants Nos. 3 and 4 in that suit from exercising any right whatsoever attached to the 34% shares of defendant No. 2 held by them and particularly any voting right in the annual general meeting scheduled to be held on the 9th March, 1987, till the decision of the suit.
This order was brought to the notice of this Court by C.M.P. forming part of the Civil Appeals Nos.
577 579 of 1987.
On 9th March, 1987, on that C.M.P. this Court passed an order directing that NTC, Swadeshi Cotton and Swadeshi Mining, all shall be entitled to vote at the annual general meeting and the question as to who were the rightful voters would be decided by the Chairman of the meeting, etc.
This was the Transferred Case No. 14 of 1987.
964 One Mukesh Jasmani, a shareholder in Swadeshi Polytex filed a writ petition in the Allahabad High Court.
The High Court by its order dt.
7th March, 1987, dismissed that writ petition, observing that Swadeshi Cotton and Swadeshi Mining would be entitled to vote at the 17th annual general meeting in respect of their shares which, according to N.T.C., had vested in them.
Against this order, Doypack Systems preferred the Special Leave Petition (civil) No. 3112 of 1987.
This Court passed orders on this petition, directing that the meeting would be held under the chairmanship of Shri Jaswant Singh notwithstanding any order made by any Court.
This Court also vacated the operative portion of the directions contained in the order dated 7th March, 1987 of the Allahabad High Court.
On 6th April, 1987, M/s. Swadeshi Mining and Manufacturing Company filed a civil writ petition Writ Petition No. 2214 of 1987 in the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench) for stay of the operation of the letters dated 24/30 March, 1987, addressed by NTC to Swadeshi Mining and Manufacturing Company and Swadeshi Cotton Mills Company Limited, calling for an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Shareholders for removal of the Directors of Swadeshi Mining and Manufacturing Company Ltd. The High Court passed an order on the 6th April, 1987, staying the operation of the said letters.
Against that order, M/s. Doypack Systems Pvt.
Ltd. filed Special Leave Petition No. 4826 of 1987 and NTC also filed a Special Leave Petition No. 5240 of 1987 in this Court.
By an order dated 5th May, 1987, this Court directed that Suit No. 506 of 1987 in the Delhi High Court and the Writ Petition No. 2214 of 1987 in the Allahabad High Court be transferred to this Court, which were registered in this Court as Transferred cases Nos.
14 and 13 of 1987 respectively.
NTC filed a civil suit in the District Court Kanpur seeking declaration of its title in respect of the shrubbery property in Kanpur.
The court refused any interlocutory injunction in the suit against which an appeal was preferred before the High Court of Allahabad and the same was dismissed.
Consequently, NTC filed a Special Leave Petition No. 7045 of 1987 in this Court.
Disposing of the matters, the Court, ^ HELD: Swadeshi Mining and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. and Others submitted that the shares in question did not vest in the Central Government.
[976B] 965 By the Act Swadeshi Cotton Mills Company Ltd. (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1986 on the appointed day "every textile undertaking" and the "right, title and interest of the company in relation to every textile mill of such textile undertakings" were transferred to and vested in the Central Government and such textile undertakings would be deemed to include "all assets".
In the context of this provision, the reliance on the decision of this Court in Balkrishnan Gupta and Others vs Swadeshi Polytex Ltd. and Others, ; , was not appropriate.
[978D E] It appears from the written statement filed by NTC on 8th February, 1987, in the suit filed by one G.G. Bakshi in Ghaziabad Court, it was claimed that NTC was entitled to take over company 's shares and investments.
On 24/30th March, 1987, NTC issued notice to the petitioners 1 and 2 stating that they were entitled to shares.
It was urged by Shri Nariman, counsel for Swadeshi Mining and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. & Ors., that this belated assertion indicated that the shares were not intended to be taken over.
The Court was unable to accept this suggestion or to draw that inference.
It did not logically follow.
[979G H; 980A] Before dealing with the main question, the Court considered an application made by Shri Nariman for the production of certain documents.
The petitioner in Transferred Case No. 13 of 1987 had sought production of the documents.
It was contended inter alia that the production of those documents was necessary to establish that the shares were never intended to be taken over and these were never considered as part of the textile undertaking, and that the documents were definitely relevant as they would throw light on the merits of the case.
The production of the documents was resisted by the Attorney General on behalf of the Union of India on the ground that the documents were not relevant and in any event most of them were privileged being part of the documents leading to the tendering of the advice by the Cabinet to the President, as contemplated by Article 74(2) of the Constitution.
[989B, C; 990A] Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the decisions of this Court in a number of cases, the Court was of the opinion that the documents in question were not relevant, and also that the Cabinet papers are protected from disclosure not by reason of their contents but because of the class to which they belong; the Cabinet papers also include papers brought into existence for the purpose of preparing submission to the Cabinet, and it is the duty of this Court to 966 prevent disclosure where Article 74(2) is applicable.
The Court was unable to accept the prayer of the petitioner to direct disclosures and production of the documents sought for.
[993F G; 994H] Coming to the main question involved, reading the provisions of section 3(1), section 4(1) and section 2(k) of the Act, each throwing light on the other, it follows that (a) under the first limb of section 3(1) of the Act, every textile undertaking; (b) under the second limb of section 3(2), every right, title and interest of the company in relation to every such undertaking, is transferred and vested, (c) the deeming provision of section 4(1) amplifies and enlarges both the limbs of the vesting section, being section 3(1), (d) the definition of the section is read into these provisions, to give a wider meaning and scope to the vesting provision and to what is transferred or vested.
[997G H; 998A] Sections 7 and 8 of the Act relied upon by the petitioners, being provisions for payment of amounts and for the issue of shares by NTC respectively, will have no bearing on the scope of the vesting provision.
As to what properties have vested cannot proceed on the hypothesis that there is a clear numerical or mathematical link between the quantum of compensation and the items of property vested.
This correlation with regard to such legislation is not available.
[998B] Section 8 refers to the payments of the amounts by Union of India to the company.
It has no bearing either on the vesting section or on section 7 except that the figure of Rs.24 crores 32 lakhs was introduced into section 7.
[998C D] In this case, a nationalisation statute is concerned.
Even with other independent management statutes, in respect of textile undertakings a series of decisions have upheld the view that the shares vest in the Government.
See National Textile Corporation Ltd. vs Sitaram Mills, [1986] Supp.
S.C.C. 117, Minerva Mills vs Union of India, ; , Goverdhan Das Narasingh Das Daga vs Union of India, , Vidharba Mills Berar Ltd. vs Union of India, and Fine Knitting Co. Ltd. vs Union of India, The above provide the informed basis on which the Court makes construction of sections 3 and 4 of the Act.
[998G H; 999A B] The expressions "and all other rights and interest in or arising out of such property, as were immediately before the appointed day, in the ownership, possession, power or control of the company in relation to the said undertakings", appearing in sub section (1) of section 4 of the 967 Act indicates that the shares which have been purchased out of the funds of the textile undertakings and which have been held for the benefit of the said textile undertakings, would come within the scope of section 4 of the Act and thus would also vest in the Central Government under section 3.
The origin of these shares and their connection with the textile undertakings had been fully corroborated.
The textile business was the only business of the Swadeshi Cotton Mills.
There was inter connection and inter relation between all the six undertakings.
Investments in Swadeshi Polytex Limited from the funds of Kanpur undertaking were always made.
Investments in Swadeshi Mining and Manufacturing Company Ltd. were always made from the funds of the Kanpur undertaking.
Assets/investments held and used for the benefit of the textile business of SCM were carried on in its textile undertakings.
[999B E] The words in the statute must Prima facie be given their ordinary meaning.
Where the grammatical construction is clear and manifest and without doubt, that construction ought to prevail unless there are some strong and obvious reasons to the contrary.
Nothing was shown to warrant that literal construction should not be given effect to.
See Chandavarkar S.R. Rao vs Asha Lata, ; at 476, approving 44 Halsbury 's Laws of England, 4th ed.
paragraph 856, p. 552, Nokes vs Doncaster Amalgamated Colliery Ltd., [1940] Appeal Cases 1014 at 1022.
It must be emphasised that interpretation must be in consonance with the Directive Principles of the State Policy in Articles 39(b) and (c) of the Constitution.[999E G] The object of interpretation of a statute is to discover the intention of the Parliament as expressed in the Act.
The dominant purpose in constructing a statute is to ascertain the intention of the legislature as expressed in the statute, considering it as a whole and in its context.
That intention and, therefore the meaning of the statute are particularly to be sought in the words used in the statute itself, which must, if they are plain and unambiguous, be applied as they stand.
In the present case, the words used represented the real intention of the Parliament as the Court found not only from the clear words used but also from the very purpose of the vesting of the shares.
If the fact is borne in mind that these shares were acquired from out of the investments made by these two companies and furthermore that the assets of the company as such minus the shares were negative and further the Act in question was passed to give effect to the principles enunciated in clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39 of the Constitution, no doubt was left that the shares vested in the Central Government by operation of sections 3 and 4 of the 968 Act.
See in this connection, the observations of Halsbury 's Laws of England, 4th Edition, Volume 44, paragraph 856, p. 522 and the cases noted therein.
[999G H; 1000A C] There is no exact correlation between the figure of capital reserve and the figure of investments.
That could not be.
These could never be equal.
The submission of the petitioners failed to take into account the fact the undertakings, other than the Kanpur undertaking, also had capital reserve, even though there was no obligation that these were excluded assets in respect of other undertakings and there were no figures of investments therein.
[1000D E] Contemporanea Expositio is a well settled principle or doctrine which applies only to the construction of ambiguous language in old statutes.
Reliance might be placed in this connection on Maxwell, 13th Ed. page 269.
It is not applicable to modern statutes.
Reference may be made to G.P. Singh, Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 3rd Ed. pages 238,239.
The leading case on Contemporanea expositio is Comppell College Belfast vs Commissioner of Valuation for Northern Ireland, , in which House of Lords made it clear that the doctrine is to be applied only to the construction of ambiguous language in the very old statutes.
Lord Watson said in Clyde Navigation Trustees vs Laird, [1983] 8 A.C. 658 that Contemporanea expositio could have no application to a modern Act.
The Court, therefore, rejected the attempt of the petitioners to lead the Court to this forbidden track by referring to various extraneous matters.
Furthermore, those external aids sought before the Court did not support the petitioners ' approach to this question at all.
[1000F H; 1001A] Sections 3 and 4 of the Act evolve a legislative policy and set out the parameters within which it has to be implemented.
The Court could not find that there was any special intention to exclude the shares in this case, as seen from the existence of at least four other Acquisition Acts which used identical phraseology in sections 3 and 4 and the other sections as well Aluminium Corporation of India Ltd. (Acquisition and Transfer of Aluminium Undertakings) Act, 1984, Amritsar Oil Works (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1982, Britannia Engineering Company (Mohmeh Unit) and the Arthur Butler and Company (Muzaffarpore) Ltd. (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1978, and the Ganesh Flour Mills Company Limited (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1984.
[1001E F] 969 It appeared to the Court that the expression "forming part of" appearing in section 27 could not be so read with section 4(1) as would have the effect of restricting or cutting down the scope and ambit of the vesting provisions in section 3(1).
The expression "pertaining to" did not mean "forming part of".
Even assuming that the expression "pertaining to" appearing in the first limb of section 4(1) means "forming part of", it would mean that only such assets as had a direct nexus with the textile mills, would fall under the first limb of section 4(1).
The shares in question would still vest in the Central Government under the second limb of section 4(1) of the Act since the shares were bought out of the income of the textile mills and were held by the company in relation to such mills.
The shares would also fall in the second limb of section 3(1) being right and title of the company in relation to the textile mills.[1002C E] On the construction of sections 3 and 4, the Court came to the conclusion that the shares vested in the Central Government even if sections 3 and 4 were read in conjunction with sections 7 and 8 of the Act on the well settled principles.
The expression 'in relation to ' has been interpreted to be words of the widest amplitude.
See National Textile Corporation Ltd. and Ors.
vs Sitaram Mills Ltd. (supra).
Section 4 appears to be an expanding section.
It introduces a deeming provision, which is intended to enlarge the meaning of a particular word or include matters which otherwise may or may not fall within the main provisions.
It is well settled that the word 'includes ' is an inclusive definition and expands the meaning.
[1002F G] To leave a company, the net wealth of which was negative at the time of take over of the management, with the shares held by it as investment in the other company, was, in the Court 's opinion, not only to defeat the principles of Articles 39(b) and (c) of the Constitution, but it would permit the company to reap the fruits of its mismanagement.
That would be an absurd situation.
It had to be borne in mind that the net wealth of the company at the time of take over was negative; hence sections 3 and 4 could be meaningfully read if all the assets including the shares were considered to be taken over by the acquisition.
That was the only irresistible conclusion that followed from the construction of the documents and the history of the Act, which expressly recites that it was to ensure the principles enunciated in clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39 of the Constitution.
The Act must be so read that it further ensures such meaning and secures the ownership and control of the material resources to the community to subserve the common good to see that the operation of the economic system does not result in injustice.
[1003F H; 1004A] 970 The shares vested in the Central Government.
Accordingly, the shares in question were vested in the N.T.C. and it had right over the said 34 per cent of the share holdings.
[1004B] The 10,00,000 shares in the Swadeshi Polytex Ltd. and 17,18,344 in the Swadeshi Mining and Manufacturing Company Ltd. held by the Swadeshi Cotton Mills vested in the Central Government under sections 3 and 4 of the Act.
[1004B C] In view of the amplitude of the language used, the immovable properties, namely, the Bungalow No. 1 and the Administrative Block, Civil Lines, Kanpur, also vested in the NTC.
[1004C D] In that view of the matter, in Transferred Case No. 13 of 1987, the Writ Petition No. 2214 of 1987 was dismissed.
All interim orders were vacated.
This would dispose of the various other SLPs and CMPs connected with the Lucknow writ petition, being SLP (Civil) No. 4826 of 1987 filed by Doypack Systems Pvt. Ltd., SLP (Civil) No. 5240 of 1987 filed by NTC.
CMPs 16918 and 16919 of 1987 in SLP No. 4826 of 1987 would stand disposed of in the above light.
[1004D F] In the Transferred Case No. 14 of 1987 (in Suit No. 506 of 1987), the Court held that 10 lakhs and 17 lakhs equity shares and the Swadeshi House at Kanpur and all the rights, title and interest attached therewith, related to the textile undertaking of defendant No. 3 and they vested in NTC with effect from 1st April, 1985, and defendants Nos. 3 and 4 were restrained by a decree of permanent injunction from dealing with them in any manner whatsoever.
Defendant No. 2 was restrained by permanent injunction from recognising defendants Nos. 3 and 4 as owners of the aforesaid shares and the Swadeshi House.
[1004F G] Defendant No. 2 was directed to enter the name of defendant No. 1, namely, NTC in its register of members and to treat the said defendant No. 1 as its share holder instead of defendants Nos. 3 and 4 in respect of the shares of defendant No. 2 held by them.
In view of the provisions of law under section 108 of the Companies Act, as there was transmission of shares by operation of law, rectification was not necessary.[1004H; 1005A B] Civil Appeals Nos.
577 to 579 of 1987 were disposed of in the above terms and it was directed that the 17th annual general meeting be held in accordance with law after giving proper notice under the 971 Chairmanship of Shri Jaswant Singh.
[1005C] CMPs Nos.
12760 of 1987 in Civil Appeal No. 577 of 1987 would stand disposed of in terms of the orders in the Transferred Case No. 14 of 1987 and it was directed that the Chairman should act in accordance with the aforesaid decision and NTC should be considered to be entitled to vote.
CMP 16887 of 1987 was rejected.
[1005D] CMP 16888 of 1987 was an application by Doypack Systems Ltd. to be impleaded as a party respondent in the Transferred Case No. 13 of 1987.
Doypack Systems was permitted to argue and was heard as a party.
No further order was necessary.
[1005E] CMPs Nos. 16889 and 17018 of 1987 were allowed.
CMP No. 18268 of 1987 was disposed of with the direction that no further documents needed to be inspected.
In view of the orders, the other CMPs were no longer necessary to be disposed of.
[1005F] Irrespective of any order passed by any court, the 17th annual general meeting should be held in accordance with law, to be presided over by Shri Jaswant Singh, recognising NTC as the rightful owner of the disputed shares.
