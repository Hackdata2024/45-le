The respondent stocked 'bunker coal ' at Candle Island in the State of Madras.
They sold the coal to steamers calling at the port of Cochin in the State of Travancore Cochin and delivered it there.
The respondent was assessed to sales tax on such sales for the year 1951 52 and 1952 53.
, The respondent contended that no sales tax could be levied on these sales since they were either sales ' in the course of export ' or in the course of inter State trade exempt from sales tax under sub cl.
(1) (b) or cl.
(2) of article 286 of the Constitution and in the alternative that they were exempt from tax under a notification dated February 5, 1954, issued by the appellant State under which sales failing within the Explanation to article 286(1)(a) made during the period 4 1 1951 to 31 3 1953 were exempted from liability to pay tax.
Held that the sales were exempt from tax under the Government Notification.
The coal was delivered to the actual consumer, i. e., the steamships in Travancore Cochin and they were at liberty to consume it :wherever they desired, either within the State or outside the choice depending on its convenience and necessity.
The delivery was for consumption within the State and the sales fell within the Explanation to Aft. 286(1)(a).
Though the sales were in the course of inter State trade which were covered by the ban on taxation imposed by article 286(2) the levy was validated by the Sales Tax Validation Act, 1956.
M. P. V. Sundararamier & Co. vs The State of Andhra Pra desh; , , relied on.
The sales were not made 'in the course of export and were not covered by the ban imposed by article 286(1)(b).
For article 286(1)(b) to apply it was not sufficient that the goods merely moved out of the territory of India, but it was further necessary that the goods should be intended to be transported to a destination beyond India.
The concept of 'export ' in article 286 postulated the existence of two termini between which the goods were intended to be transported.
