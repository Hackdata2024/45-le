Rashid Ahmed vs Munsicipal Board, Kairana, ; and K. section Rashid and Son vs The Income tax Investigation Commission ; , relied on.
(2) Tile Indian Evidence Act has no application to en quiries conducted by tribunals.
The law only requires that tribunals should observe rules of natural justice such as that a party should have the opportunity of adducing all relevant evidence on which he relies, that the evidence of the opponent should be taken in his presence and that he should be given the opportunity of cross examining the witnesses examined by that party, and that no materials should be relied on against him without his being given an opportunity of explaining them.
If these rules are satis fied then the enquiry is not open to attack on the ground that the procedure laid down in the Indian Evidence Act for taking evidence was not strictly followed.
