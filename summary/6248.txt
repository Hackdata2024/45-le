The appellant is a firm dealing in the manufacture and sale of Tents and Tarpaulins at Jodhpur in Rajasthan.
It carried on a regular business of supplying these goods to defence services.
The Director General of Supplies and Dis posal invited tenders for the supply of tents and the appel lant firm submitted its tender, which was accepted.
The said contract was of two kinds of tents viz, "Flies Inner" and "Flies Outer", the agreed rate of the latter was Rs.225 per tent and the quantity was 15,000.
As per the terms of the contract, the goods were to be inspected at the premises of the appellant firm and after inspection the same were to be despatched to Commandant, C.O.D., Kanpur.
As regards the mode of payment of the price of the goods, 95% of the price was to be paid on proof of despatch of goods and production of inspection note, and 5% latter.
On October 14, 1968 one consignment of 1500 tents was despatched to C.O.D. Kanpur from Jodhpur by the appellant under Railway Receipt No. 502671 and 95% of the price was paid to the appellant.
The commandant, C.O.D. Kanpur, the consignee reported that 224 tents out of the said sale consignment had not been received at Kanpur and for that reason a sum of Rs.51,912 being the price of 224 tents was deducted from the amounts due to the appellant, under anoth er contract.
The Traffic Officer, Commandant C.O.D. had filed a claim with the railways for short delivery of 224 tents.
Despite repeated requests by the appellant for the payment of the said amount, the same was not paid to it.
As such the appellant filed a suit in Delhi High Court for the recovery of the principal amount as also for the interest thereon.
In the suit, the appellant also claimed interest on two other consignments, as its balance price i.e. 5% amount ing to Rs.24,357 was paid after a delay of 3 years and thus a sum of Rs.8,525 was claimed as interest @ 12% per annum from 1.1.69 to 1.12.71.
Thus the total claim was of Rs.74.972.
128 The defence of Respondents 1, 2 & 5 was that 224 tents were received short and as such a sum of Rs.51,912 its price was rightly deducted from the appellant 's bill.
Respondents 3 & 4 (Railways ' Officials) filed a State ment that only 11 tents were delivered short for which the admitted liability was Rs.2,475, the same having been paid to C.O.D. Kanpur by debit adjustment.
The Trial Judge by his Order dated February 12, 1982 dismissed the claim of the appellant substantially but so for as the amount of Rs.2,475 regarding the shortage of 11 tents was concerned, the same was decreed with interest.
Against the Judgment and Order of the Trial Judge, the appellant preferred an appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court and the same having been dismissed, the appellant has come up in appeal to this Court after obtain ing Special Leave.
Allowing the appeal, this Court, HELD: In view of the terms and conditions of the con tract embodied in clause 11 of the schedule of acceptance of tender regarding the place of delivery "F.O.R.
