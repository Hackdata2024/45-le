During the assessment year, the company had not distributed dividends to the extent of 60% of its profits and an order under section 23A(1) of the Act was passed by the Income tax Officer.
The question referred by the Tribunal to the High Court was whether at the relevant time the assessee company could be deemed to be a company in which the public were substantially interested, i.e., held 25% of the voting power, was answered in the negative.
Held, that the test that no holding by the Directors of a company could be regarded as one in which the public were substantially interested was not the correct test to apply.
The test as laid down in Raghuvanshi Mills vs Commissioner of Income tax, ; , would apply to this Case.
Held, further, that the paramount condition in applying the proviso and the explanation of section 23A(1) was that the public should be beneficially interested in 25% of the voting power.
, The explanation to section 23A required that shares held by the company should be considered as held by the public, only if section 23A did not apply to it.
