The appellant, the author of a short story and the printer and publisher of the story were convicted under section 292 I.P.C. on a charge of obscenity.
Setting aside the conviction this Court, HELD: It is the duty of the Court to consider the article, story or book by taking an overall view of the entire work and to determine whether the obscene passages are so likely to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such influences and in whose hands the book is likely to fall; and in doing so the influence of the book on the social morality of our contemporary society cannot be overlooked.
Even so as the question of obscenity may have to be judged in the light of the claim that the work has a predominant literary merit, it may be necessary if it is at all required, to rely to a certain extent on the evidence and views of leading litterateurs on that aspect.
[82 D; 83 E G] To insist that the standard would always be for the writer to see that the adolescent ought not to be brought into contact with sex or that if they read any references to sex in what is written, whether that is the dominant theme or not, they would be affected, would be to require the authors to write books only for the adolescent and not for the adults What has to be seen is that whether a class, not an isolated case, into whose hands the book, article or story falls suffer in their moral outlook or become depraved by reading it or might have impure or lecherous thoughts aroused in their minds.
The charge of obscenity must, therefore, be judged from this aspect.
