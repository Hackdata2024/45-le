The appellant and respondents No. 3 and 4 applied for the grant of nontemporary stage carriage permits.
The Regional Transport Authority granted the permits to the appellant and respondent No. 4 and rejected the application of respondent No. 3.
Respondent No. 3 filed an appeal to the State Transport Appellate Tribunal.
The notice of appeal was served upon the appellant where the date and time were mentioned but the place was not mentioned.
Since the appellant did not appear the appeal was heard ex parte.
The Tribunal set aside the order of the Transport Authority and granted the permit in favour of respondent No. 3.
A writ petition filed by the appellant against the order of the Tribunal was dismissed summarily by the learned Single Judge by a long speaking order.
A Division Bench dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant.
In an appeal by Special Leave the appellant contended: 1.
The notice as required by rule 108(c) of the Rajasthan Motor Vehicles Rules, 1951 served on the appellant was not proper notice since it did not mention the place of the hearing of the appeal.
The Tribunal did not consider the relevant matters as mentioned in section 47(a) to (f).
HELD: 1.
The omission to mention the place is not fatal.
The appellant is a resident of Jaipur where also the office of the Tribunal is situated.
He was a Stage Carriage permit holder and not a stranger to the Transport authorities.
In fact, hearing of the appeal was adjourned twice even after the date mentioned in the notice.
[460 F] 2.
The Regional Transport Authority did not make any reference to the relevant considerations under section 47 of the Act.
The Tribunal on the other hand has considered various aspects of the matter as required by section 47 although without a reference to that section.
The Tribunal and the learned Single Judge duly considered the whole matter and the Division Bench was justified in summarily rejecting the special appeal.
