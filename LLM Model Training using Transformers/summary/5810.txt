The petitioners participated in the arbitration without demur.
When the award was made in 1981 no objection was taken by them that it was bad being unreasoned one.
The High Court dismissed the challenge to the award.
In the special leave petition it was contended for them that relevant documents had not been taken into consideration.
Dismissing the special leave petition, HELD: The High Court has pointed out that the award does not indicate that all relevant documents had not been taken into consideration.
The parties participated in the arbitration.
There is no allegation of any violation of principles of natural justice.
There is no mistake of law apparent on the face of the award or gross mistake of facts resulting in miscarriage of justice or of equity.
It would, therefore, be unjust under article 136 of the Constitution to interfere or keep the finding at bay.
