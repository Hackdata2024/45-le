The property under dispute was put up for sale at two different auctions by the Managing Officer, Amritsar.
The Rehabilitation authorities cancelled the bid of the first auction purchaser Smt.
Rup Kaur, holding that she had failed to deposit the sale price in spite of issuing her a regis tered notice, and at the.
second auction the appellant 's bid was accepted.
In a petition filed under article 226, a Single Judge of the High Court found the findings of facts to be erroneous and the impugned order void, and granted a writ in favour of Smt.
Rup Kaur.
On appeal, the decision was upheld by a Division Bench of the High Court.
Dismissing the appeal the Court, HELD: (1) The High Court does not sit as a court of appeal to substitute its own judgment for that of the au thorities which are empowered to give their decisions, but apart from jurisdictional errors, the High Court may correct errors apparent on the face of the record.
An error to be apparent must be one which does not take prolonged arguments to bring it to the surface.
The Single Judge 's conclusion that provisions of Rule 90 of the Displaced Persons Compensation and Rehabilitation Rules, 1955, had not been complied with, was not erroneous.

M.B. Tirumale [1960] (1) SCR 890, ap plied Hiralal Kher vs The Chief Settlement Commissioner New Delhi , referred to.
(2) It is a settled rule of practice of this Court not to interfere with the ' exercise of discretionary powers of High Courts under article 226 of the Constitution merely be cause two views are possible upon the facts of a case.
For interference by this Court, the question must involve at least a matter of public or general importance or the injus tice suffered by an individual due to an error of law should be so gross as to touch the conscience of this Court in which case it would be deemed to be one of more than private importance.
