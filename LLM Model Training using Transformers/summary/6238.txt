Pursuant to this Court 's direction in K. Siva Reddy & Ors.
vs State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors.
, ; , the State Government issued Circular dated 12.8.1988, fixing the guideline for drawing up of inter se seniority list of direct recruit and promotee Deputy Executive Engi neers in Andhra Pradesh Engineering Service.
This Circular was challenged by the petitioners.
Promotee Engineers, in a Writ Petition filed in this Court, contending that since they had put in continuous service of 6 to 7 years by 1982 and their services had been regularised in the post of Deputy Executive Engineer in the year 1974 75, direct re cruits appointed in the year 1982 could not, under any law, be placed above them.
Dismissing the writ petition, this Court, HELD: Promotees had exceeded the quota and even got regularised in respect of the posts in excess of the limit.
Taking into consideration the fact that regularisation had been done after the promotees had put in some years of service and disturbing regularisation would considerably affect the officers concerned, regularisation was not inter fered with.
This Court 's intention was not to take away the benefit of regularisation in respect of the officers belong ing to the promotee group in excess of their quota but the Court did not intend to allow such regularised officers in excess of the quota to also have the benefit of such service for purposes of seniority.
[142 H; 143A B] A reading of the judgment in Siva Reddy 's case clearly indicates that this Court intended what the Government have laid down by way of guideline.
Therefore, there is no justi fication to interfere with the Government direction. [143B] 141 K. Siva Reddy & Ors.
