The appellant was tried along with P for the offence of murder.
The prosecution case was that the appellant, in conspiracy with P who was employed as a servant in the house of the deceased, took advantage of the deceased being alone in the house with her child, went upstairs and killed her and stole her ornaments, while P remained downstairs with the child.
The evidence upon which the prosecution relied for conviction consisted of the confession of P, the statement of the appellant which led to the recovery of the ornaments belonging to the deceased from the possession of the mistress of the appellant, the recovery of a blood stained dagger from his belongings at the police station and his conduct after the murder.
The confession of P was later retracted by him in the Court of 'Session.
It was contended for the appellant that a retracted confession of an accused cannot be used against his co accused Held, that a voluntary and true confession made by an accused though it was subsequently retracted by him, can be taken into consideration against a co accused by virtue Of section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act, but as a matter of prudence and practice the court should not act upon it to sustain a conviction of the co accused without full and strong corroboration in material particulars both as to the crime and as to his connection with that crime.
The amount of credibility to be attached to a retracted con fession would depend upon the circumstances of each particular case.
Held, further, that on the evidence in the case the confes sion of P was voluntary and true and was strongly corroborated in material particulars both concerning the general story told in the confession concerning the crime and the appellant 's connection with crime.
