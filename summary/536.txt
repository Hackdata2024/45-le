The appellant filed the necessary returns, as required by the provisions of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1944, and produced the account books.
The Sales Tax Officer considered that the account books were not dependable and, after rejecting them as well as the returns, proceeded to estimate the gross turnover by adopting a figure by pure guess, without reference to any evidence or material, and made the assessment under section 10 (2) (b) of the Act.
Held, that under section 1O (2) (b) of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1944, a duty is imposed on the assessing authority to make the assessment after hearing such evidence as the assessee may produce and such other evidence as the assessing authority may require on specified points, and, in case the returns of the assessee and his books of account are rejected, the assessing authority must make an estimate, but this must be based on such evidence or material as the assessing authority has before him, including the assessee 's circumstances, knowledge of previous returns and all other matters which the assessing authority thinks will assist him in arriving at a fair and proper estimate.
