The petitioner appellant is engaged in the manufacture of various varieties of soaps.
The dispute arose as to the eligibility of the appellants to the concession under rule 8(1) of the Central Excise Rule 1944 through Notification No. 46 of 1972 subsequently amended by Notification Nos.
153 of 1973 dated 24.7.73 of 25 of 1975 dated 1.3.75.
Resolving the dispute as to the interpretation of rules whether rice bran fatty acid is different from the rice Bran Oil as held by the Tribunal the Court came to the conclusion that the view taken by the Excise authorities as well as by the Tribunal proceeded upon too narrow an interpretation of the notification and erred in not granting the exemption to the assessee.
While allowing the appeals, this Court, HELD: Rice bran oil contains glycerol and other impuri ties which have to be removed by a process of hydrolysis or hydrogenation and it is only the resultant purified rice bran oil that is actually used in the manufacture of soap.
[843G] A factory which consumes rice bran oil in the manufac ture of soap in its factory first converts the oil into hydrogenated oil or fatty acid and then manufactures soap out of the latter.
[844A] In trying to understand the language used by an exemp tion notification one should keep in mind two important aspects; (a) the object and purpose of the exemption and (b) the nature of the actual process involved in the manufacture of the commodity in relation to which exemption is granted.
[843F] Construing the notifications literally but reasonably in the light of 840 the process of manufacture as explained by the Tribunal, the soap manufactured by the assessee is "soap made from indige nous rice bran oil" and is entitled to the exemption under the notifications to the extent permissible thereunder.
[844H 845A] The terms of the notification do not have the effect of excluding cases where the manufacture of soap is done out of rice bran oil but the entire process is not carried out by the assessee itself.
