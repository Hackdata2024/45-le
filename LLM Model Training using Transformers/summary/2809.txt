The contract of sale entered into by the respondent expressly provided that the timber agreed to be sold shall be severed.
The High Court held that the sale of standing trees was not a sale of goods chargeable to sales tax under the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959.
and the decision was confirmed by this Court on appeal.
But after the judgment of the High Court and before the appeal was heard in this Court, the expression "goods" in the Act was amended by Maharashtra Act 15 of 1967 with retrospective operation, so that, it included at all relevant times, standing timber agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale.
In a petition for review to this Court, HELD : Since the judgment of this Court suffers from an error apparent on the face of the record, the judgment should be reviewed and the appeal allowed.
[47C] A State Legislature may not extend the import of the expression sale of goods" so as to impose liability for tax on transactions which are not sales of goods within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act.
But, by the inclusive definition in section 2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act, things which are attached to the land may be the subject matter of contract of sale provided that under the terms of the contract they are to be severed before sale of under the contract of sale.
The timber in the present case was therefore "goods" within the meaning of section 2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act.
Since the expression " sale of goods" in Entry 54, List II, of the Constitution has the same meaning as that expression has in the Sale of Goods Act, the amendment is valid.
