Natural justice requires that before a law can become operative it must be promulgated or published.
It must be broadcast in some recognisable way so that all men may know what it is; or at least there must be some special rule or regulation or customary channel by or through which such knowledge can be acquired with the exercise of due and reasonable diligence.
The Council of Ministers appointed by the Crown Repre sentative for the government and administration of the Jaipur State passed a Resolution in 1923 purporting to enact a law called the Jaipur Opium Act, but this law was neither promulgated or published in the Gazette nor made known to the public.
The Jaipur Laws Act, 1923, which was also passed by the Council and which came into force on the 1st November, 1924, provided by section 3 (b) that the law to be administered by the court of the Jaipur State shall be. " (b) all the regulations now in force within the said terri tories and the enactments and regulations that may hereafter be passed from time to.
time by the State and published in the Official Gazette.
" In 1938 the Jaipur Opium Act was amended by adding a clause to the effect that "it shall come into force from the 1st of September, 1924.
" Held, that the mere passing of the Resolution of the Council without further publication or promulgation of the law was not sufficient to make the law operative and the Jaipur Opium Act was not therefore a valid law.
Held fur ther, that the said Act was not saved by section 3 (b) of the Jaipur Laws Act, 1923, as it was not a valid law in force on the 1st November, 1924, and the mere addition of a clause in 1938 that it shall come into force in 1924 was of no use.
