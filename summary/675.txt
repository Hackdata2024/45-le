The appellants were Taluqdars owning taluqdari villages in District Ahmedabad, State of Bombay.
In 1922 23 there was a revision settlement of land revenue and the aggregate sum of land revenue payable by each taluqdari estate was fixed.
In 1925 26, in exercise of the powers conferred by section 22 of the Gujrat Taluqdars Act, 1888 (Bom.
VI of 1888), the Government of Bombay ascertained and declared the jama payable by each taluq which was much less than the amount of land revenue and the said declaration was to remain in force for thirty years.
With the passing in 1949 of the Bombay Taluqdari Abolition Act, 1949, the taluqdari estates of the appellants were abolished and they became occupants of the lands and, after the expiry of the thirty years, were called upon to pay the full land revenue assessment in respect of the lands.
It was contended on behalf of the appellants that by reason of section II7R of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, i879, the declaration made by the Governor in council fixing the amount of jama for a period of thirty years would continue to be in force even after the expiry of that period till a revision settlement was made and the Government was precluded from demanding the higher amount of revenue till then.
Held, that the contention must fail.
The jama payable by the Taluqdars under section 22 Of the Gujrat Taluqdars Act, 1888, was distinct from the revenue assessment of land comprised in the taluqdari estate and they could not be equated.
The declaration under section 22 or the fixation of the jama under section 23(1) of the Act was in the nature of a settlement entered into between the Government on the one hand and the Taluqdar on the other but that was no settlement of land revenue within the meaning of section II7R of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879.
As section 5(2) (b) of the Bombay Taluqdari Tenure Abolition Act, 1949, expressly saved the settlement made under section 23 and the 912 declaration under section 22 of the Gujrat Taluqdars Act, the appellants were liable to pay the entire land revenue after the expiry Of 30 years, i.e., from the year 1955 56.
