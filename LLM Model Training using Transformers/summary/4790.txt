In compliance with directions given by the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, the Bombay High Court withdrew to itself Special Case No. 24 of 1982 and Special Case No. 5/83 pending in the Court of the Special Judge, Greater Bombay and assigned the said two cases to Mr. Justice S.N. Khatri a sitting Judge of the said court.
When the cases were taken up for hearing, two preliminary contentions were raised as to whether State should appoint a Public Prosecutor to conduct the trial and what should be the procedure to be followed and from what stage of the trial.
Hence the two applications for classification.

It is for the complainant to decide who should be his learned advocate in charge of the Prosecution.
