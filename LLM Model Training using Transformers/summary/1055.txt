The appellants, a Hindu undivided family, carrying on business in the former State of Mysore, were assessed under the Mysore Income tax Act for the year of assessment 1949 50 corresponding to the year of account July 1, 1948, to June 30, 1949.
The Indian Income tax Act came into force in that area in April 1, 1950, and on December 26, 1950, notice under section 22(2) of that Act was served upon the appellants to submit their return for the assessment year 1950 51.
On September 8, 1952, the appellants submitted their return stating that they had no assessable income for that year.
The Income Tax Officer passed on that return an order, "no proceeding", and closed the assessment.
When the appellants submitted their return for the next assessment year, their books of account disclosed an opening cash credit balance of Rs. 1,87,000 and odd on July 1. 1949.
They failed to produce the books of account of the previous years, and the Income tax Officer held that Rs. 1,37,000 out of the said opening balance represented income from an undisclosed source.
The appellants submitted a fresh return for the assessment year 1950 51 purporting to do so under section 22(3) of the Indian Incometax Act.
Pursuant to the direction of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, the Income Tax Officer on October 15, 1957, served on the appellants a notice under section 34 of the Act and thereupon the appellants moved the High Court under article 226 for an order quashing the said notice and the proceeding as without jurisdiction.
The High Court dismissed the petition.
Held, that it was not correct to say that the issue of the notice for reassessment was without jurisdiction as the assessment was yet pending.
Under section 23(1) of the Indian Income tax Act, it is open to the Income tax Officer, if he is satisfied as to correctness of the return filed by the assessee, to assess the income and determine the sum payable on the basis of the return without requiring the assessee either to be present or to Produce evidence.
The order 'no proceeding recorded on the.
return must, therefore, mean that the Income Tax Officer bad accepted the previous return and assessed the income as nil.
A revised return under section 22(3) filed by the assessee may be 912 entertained only before the order of assessment and not thereafter.
Lodging of such a return after the assessment is no bar to reassessment under section 34(1) of the Act.
It could not be said, having regard to the provisions of section 13(1) of the Finance Act (XXV of 1950) and cl.
5(1) of Part.
B States (Taxation Concessions) Order 1950, issued by the Central Government under section 60A of the Indian Income tax Act, that for the assessment year 1950 51 the appellants were assessable under the Mysore Income tax Act and not under the Indian Income tax Act.
