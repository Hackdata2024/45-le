A complaint was filed against the appellant on January 13,1953, and the Special Magistrate trying him commenced the recording of evidence on July 4, 955.
During the trial the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act (26 of 955) came into force on January 2, 1956, which introduced section 342 A in the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The appellant made an application to the Magistrate claiming the right to appear as a witness on his own behalf under section 342 A in disproof of the charges made against him.
The Magistrate rejected the application on the ground that section 342 A could not be applied to pending proceedings which would be according to the procedure laid down in the unamended Code: Held, that on a plain construction of section ii6 of the amending Act which provided for procedure to be followed in pending cases section 342 A was clearly applicable in such cases.
Under the general law also a change in procedure operates retrospectively.
