Section 3 of the empowers the Central Government to extend by notification to any cantonment any enactment relating to the control of rent and regulation of house accommodation which was in force on the date of notification in the State in which the cantonment was situated.
In exercise of this power the Central Government by a notification dated November 21, 1969 extended the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949 to the cantonments in the States of Haryana and Punjab.
By virtue of section 3(2) which was added in the 1957 Act in 1972, the Central Government enjoyed power to extend an enactment from a date earlier than the date of notification or from a future date.
In January, 1974 the Central Government issued a notification superseding tho earlier notification dated November 21, 1969 and extended afresh the 1949 Act to cantonments in Haryana and Punjab.
Section 13(2)(ii)(a) of the 1949 Act provides for an order of eviction if the Controller is satisfied that the tenant has, after the commencement of this Act without the written consent of the landlord has sublet the entire building or a portion thereof.
The respondent landlord in the instant case applied for possession of his premises in Ambala Cantonment under the occupation of the appellant tenant on the ground that without his written consent the tenant had sub let the shop.
The appellant claimed that it was the joint Hindu family of which he was a member that was the tenant and therefore there was no question of the premises being sub let by him to the joint family.
The Rent Controller ordered eviction.
His order was affirmed by the appellate authority.
The High Court dismissed the tenant 's revision application.
Before this Court it was contended that (1) there was no evidence that the shop was sub let; (2) since the 1949 Act was not in force in the Ambala Cantonment in 1967 when the sub letting was alleged to have taken place, the landlord could not avail of the provisions of that Act and (3) the notification issued in 1974 was without statutory sanction and was invalid because once the Central Government had exercised the power in 1969 that power stood exhausted and the Government could not invoke it again in 1974.
491 Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: 1 The finding of the High Court and the Rent Controller that the tenant had sub let the shop is unassailable.
The shop, to begin with, was let out to the appellant alone and not to the joint Hindu family.
The business carried on by him was later taken over by a partnership consisting of the father and brothers and he was no longer the proprietor of the business.
[493 G & B] 2(a) The 1949 Act became law operating in the Ambala Cantonment with affect from November 21, 1969 when the Central Government extended that Act to the cantonments in Haryana and Punjab.
The sub letting having taken place in 1967 when the 1949 Act was not in force the landlord could not avail of the provisions of that Act.
[494B D] (b) In the context of section 13(2)(ii)(a) of the 1949 Act the words "has sub let" imply that the sub letting must subsist on the date when the Act came into force.
Tho words "has sub let", if they are unqualified by any reference to the commencement of the Act, refer to a transaction of sub letting entered into before or after commencement of tho Act and in a case where sub letting has been effected before the commencement of the Act the sub lease must subsist, and the rights under it continue to now, on the date of the commencement of the Act.
In the present case, section 13(2)(ii)(a) confines its scope to sub leases effected after the commencement of the Act, that is to say, transactions of sub letting effected after the date when the Act came into force.
For that reason, a sub letting effected before the commencement of the Act cannot be brought within the mischief of the section even though it continues to subsist on or after the commencement of the Act.
[494H; 495A B] Goppulal vs Thakurji Shriji Shriji Dwarkadheeshji & Anr.
; held inapplicable.
3(a) By virtue of tho amendments made to tho 1957 Act in 1972 the 1949 Act will be deemed to have come into force in the Ambala cantonment on January 26, 1950.
Therefore, the sub letting effected in 1967 must plainly be regarded as having been made after the commencement of that Act.
[496D E] (b) In issuing the notification dated January 24, 1974 and thereby extending the 1949 Act to the Ambala Cantonment retrospectively with effect from January 26, 1950 tho Central Government exercised a power not available to it when it issued tho earlier notification of November 21, 1969.
The contention that the notification of January, 1974 amounted to a further exercise of the same power conferred by section 3 of the 1957 Act is without force.
[497 D E] The power under which the notification of January, 1974 had been issued is a separate and distinct power from that under which the earlier notification was made.
The power now exercised passed into tho 1957 Act when it was amended in 1972.
In its nature and quality it is not identifiable with the power vested under the unamended Act.
A power conferred by statute is distinguished by the character and content of its essential components.
If one or more material components characterising the power cannot be identified with the material components of another, they are two different and distinct powers.
The power under the unamended Act was a limited Dower 492 which could operate prospectively only while the power after amendment was retrospective.
It was a power whose reach and cover extended far beyond what the power under the unamended Act could achieve.
[497 A C] (c) The words "this Act" occurring in the commencement of this Act" in clause (c) of the proviso to section 3(2) of the 1957 Act refer to the principal Act in which sub section (2) was inserted in section 3 and not to the Amendment Act of 1972.
By virtue of section 2(2) as amended it is the principal Act which must be deemed to have come into force on January 26, 1950 [497 G]
