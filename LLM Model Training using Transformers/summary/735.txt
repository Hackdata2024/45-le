The appellant was committed to the Court of Session for trial of offences under section 5(2) Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and section 161 Indian Penal Code.
Shortly thereafter, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1952 came into force.
An Assistant Sessions judge tried the appellant and convicted him of the offences charged.
The appellant contended that the trial was vitiated as the investigation had been made by a police officer below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police and that the Assistant Sessions judge had no jurisdiction to try the case as it was triable by a Special Judge.
Held that, the Assistant Sessions judge had jurisdiction to 777 try the case.
Section 10 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1952 transferred only cases pending before Magistrates to Special judges but did not transfer cases which had been committed to Court of Session before the Act came into force.

Held further that, the conviction was not vitiated by the investigation having been made by an officer below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police.
If the matter had been urged before the Courts at an early stage it would have had to take steps to get the illegality cured by ordering fresh investigations.
But the appellant could not be permitted to raise the questions whether the objection regarding investigation had been taken at the earliest stage as the question had not been raised in the Courts below.
