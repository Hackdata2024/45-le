The petitioner detenue was detained pursuant to an order of detention passed under section 3(2) of the .
The detention was based on three incidents in respect of which criminal Cases were already pending against the petitioner.
Before the detention order was passed, he had moved applications for bail and was released on three successive days in the three cases.
The detention order did not mention the fact that the detenue had made application for bail in the three criminal cases relating to the afore said incidents and was enlarged on bail.
The petitioner moved the High Courts for quashing the order of detention.
The High Court dismissed the petition.
The petitioner in special leave petition against the judgment of the High Court and his wife in a Writ Petition under article 32 of the Constitution prayed for quashing the aforesaid order of detention on the ground that there was clear indication of non application of mind by the detaining authority when it passed the detention order.
Allowing the petitions, HELD: (1) This is not a fit case to resort to preventive detention.
As there was clear non application of mind on the part of the detaining authority, the judgment of the High Court under appeal is set aside and the order of detention is quashed and it is directed that the petitioner be re leased forthwith.
[223E G] (2) There is absolutely no mention in the order about the fact that the petitioner was an under trial prisoner, that he was arrested in connection with the three cases, that applications for bail were pending and that he was released on three successive days in the three cases.
This indicates a total absence of application of mind on the part of detaining 222 authority while passing the order of detention.
