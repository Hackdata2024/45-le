The standard of proof required to convict a person on circumstantial evidence is well established by a series of decisions of the Supreme Court.
According to that standard the circumstances relied upon in support of the conviction must be fully established and the chain of evidence furnished by those circumstances must be so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion con sistent with the innocence of the accused.
The appellant was convicted under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to transportation for life.
There were no eyewitnesses to the murder and the conviction of the appellant rested solely on the circumstantial evidence which was relied on by the courts below.
The various facts which formed the links in the chain of circumstantial evidence in the present case taken together advanced the case against the appellant very much beyond suspicion and reasonably and definitely pointed to the appellant as the person who committed the murder.
In a case like the present when the various links in the chain had been satisfactorily made out and the circumstances pointed to the appellant as the probable assailant with reasonable definiteness and in proximity to the deceased as regards time and situation, and be offered no explanation, which if accepted, though not proved, would afford a reasonable basis for a conclusion on the entire case consistent with his innocence, such absence of explanation or false explanation would itself be an additional link which completed the chain.
