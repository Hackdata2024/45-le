The appellant was the Mahant of the Asthal Estate in Bihar which was in the management of a Receiver appointed by the Civil Court in a suit relating to the estate.
On appeal the question that arose for decision in this Court was whether the appellant Mahant was liable to be assessed under the Bihar Agricultural Income tax Act, 1948, to pay agricultural income tax for the year in which the estate was in the management of the Court Receiver.
Held, that the income though collected by the Receiver was the income of the appellant.
By virtue of the provisions of sections 2, cl.
(m) and 13 of the Bihar Agricultural Income tax Act it was open to the taxing authorities to treat the Receiver as the assessee because he held the property from which income was derived, but on that account the income in the hand of the owner was not exempt from liability to assessment of tax.
Section 3 of the Act provides for charging agricultural income of every person " as defined in section 2, cl.
(m) which includes a receiver and section E3 merely provides a machinery for recovery of tax from "Persons" including receivers and is not by itself a charging section.
