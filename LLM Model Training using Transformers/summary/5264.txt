In a writ petition filed under Article 32 of the Consti tution of India, the Court found that good and substantial reasons existed for directing the petitioner to approach the concerned High Court in the first instance instead of knock ing at the doors of this Court straightaway.
While directing so, this Court, HELD: 1.
If Supreme Court takes upon itself to do every thing which even the High Court can do, this Court will not be able to do what this Court alone can do under article 136 of the Constitution of India, and other provisions conferring exclusive jurisdiction on this Court.
There is no reason to assume that the concerned High Court will not do justice.
Or that this Court alone can do justice.
If this Court enter tains Writ Petitions at the instance of parties who approach this Court directly instead of approaching the concerned High Court in the first instance, tens of thousands of Writ Petitions would in course of time be instituted in this Court directly.
The inevitable result will be that the arrears pertaining to matters in respect of which this Court exercises exclusive jurisdiction under the Constitution will assume more alarming proportions.
[316B D] 2.
It is as important to do justice at this level, as to inspire confidence in the litigants that justice will be meted out to them at the High Court level, and other levels.
Faith must be inspired in the hierarchy of Courts and the institution as a whole.
Not only in this Court alone.
And this objective can be achieved only by this Court showing trust in the High Courts by directing the litigants to approach the High Courts in 315 the first instance.
Besides, as a matter of fact, if matters like the present one are instituted in the High Courts, there is a likelihood of the same being disposed of much more quickly, and equally effectively, on account of the decentralisation of the process of administering justice.
