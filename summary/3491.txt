On the expiry of his sub lease for extracting phosphate form an area of 400 hectares situate in Singbhum district, Bihar, the appellant applied to the State Government for a grant of fresh lease.
For nine months the State Government failed to dispose of his application, and under section 24(3) of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, it was deemed to have been refused.
Under Rule 54 of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, the appellant applied for revision and the Central Government directed the State Government to consider his application on merits.
The State Government rejected the application on the ground that it had decided not to grant lease for phosphate to individuals or private parties, but to work this mineral in the public sector.
The appellant again applied for revision during the pendency of which an advertisement of the State Government appeared in the 'Statesman ' indicating the abandonment of its proposal to mine phosphate and apatite in the public sector.
The appellant brought the advertisement to the notice of the Central Government, but it rejected his revision application, completely disregarding the advertisement.
The appellant preferred an appeal to this Court by special leave.
Allowing the appeal and remanding the case to the Central Government, the Court, ^ HELD: The Central Government failed to take into consideration this advertisement which appeared to indicate a change in the stand of the State Government, and made its order in complete disregard of it.
This was clear non application of mind on the part of the Central Government to a very material circumstance which was brought to its notice before its disposal of the under revision application.
The order of the Central Government, therefore.
suffers from a patent error.
