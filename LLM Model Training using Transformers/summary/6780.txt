The appellant held a Stage Carriage Permit for plying his vehicle on the Kota Khanpur route, which overlaps a portion of the KotaSangod route.
The State Road Transport Corporation vide Notification dated 11.10.1979 proposed a scheme under Section 68 C of the for the exclusive operation of its vehicles on the Kota Sangod route.
The affected operators of the route, including the appellant, filed their objections against the scheme before the authority appointed by the State Government which ap proved the scheme.
Before the State Government could issue the final Noti fication under Section 68 D(3) of the old Act, the appellant and other affected operators made representation to the Minister for Transport for affording them a fresh opportuni ty of hearing.
501 Meanwhile, the was enforced with effect from 1.7.1989 repealing the old Act.
The appellant, thereupon, filed a writ petition before the High Court for restraining the State Government from issuing the final Notification on the ground that on the enforcement of the new Act, the Notification dated 11.10.1979 issued under Section 68 C of the old Act had lapsed on account of delay in finalisation of the same.
A similar writ petition had been filed earlier in re spect of Kishangarh Sarwad route by one affected party, on similar grounds.
A learned Single Judge of the High Court dismissed that writ petition holding that the draft scheme under the old Act was saved by the new Act and the same could legally be finalised under the provisions of the new Act.
When he filed a Letters Patent Appeal, the Division Bench dismissed the Appeal as well as the various writ petitions including that of the appellant by a common order, against which the present appeal was made.
After the judgment of the High Court, the final notifi cation was published in the Official Gazette on 29.8.1990 section 100(3) of the new Act.
The appellant, contended before the Court that since there was undue delay of 11 years in issuing the final Notification, the scheme as proposed under Section 68 C of the old Act should be deemed to have lapsed and the State Government had no authority or jurisdiction to finalise the same or to issue Notification under Section 100(3) of the new Act; that since the draft scheme dated 11.10.1979 was not finalised under Section 100(3) of the new Act, the same had lapsed after one year from the date of the notification issued section 68 C of the old Act; and that since period of one year had already expired from the date of the publica tion of the scheme under Section 68 C of old Act, the scheme automatically lapsed and the same could not be finally published under Section 100 of the new Act.
Dismissing the appeal this Court, HELD: 1.1.
The object and purpose of Section 100(4) is to avoid delay in finalising a scheme.
The Parliament was aware that under the old Act schemes were not finalised for long years as a result of which public interest suffered, therefore, it prescribed a time frame for the approval and publication of schemes.
Sub section (4) prescribes a period of limitation during which the State Government should hear 502 and consider the objections of the objectors and finalise the scheme and publish the same in the Official Gazette and on its failure to do so within that period, penal conse quences would ensue as a result of which the scheme itself shall stand lapsed.
[507H 508A, 507F G] 1.2.
The Legislative intent is clear that the schemes proposed under Section 68 C of the old Act pending on the date of the commencement of the new Act should not lapse instead those schemes should be finalised in accordance with the provisions of Section 100 of the new Act.
The pending schemes were therefore saved and the same were to be fina lised within one year as contemplated by Section 100(4) of the new Act.
[509C D] 1.3.
Section 217(2)(e) has been enacted to save the schemes published under Section 68 C of the old Act which were pending on the date of the commencement of the Act with a further direction that the same shall be finalised in accordance with Section 100 of the Act.
[510C ] 1.4.
If the period of one year from the date of the publication of proposed scheme is applied to the pending schemes under Section 68 C of the old Act, the purpose and object of saving the old schemes under Clause (e) of Section 217(2) of the new Act would be frustrated.
[509E F] 2.1.
While Section 217(2)(e) permits finalisation of a scheme in accordance with Section 100 of the new Act, sub section (4) of Section 100 lays down that a scheme if not finalised within a period of one year shall be deemed to have lapsed.
If the period of one year as prescribed under Section 100(4) is not computed from the date of publication of the scheme under Section 68 C of the old Act and instead the period of one year is computed from the date of com mencement of the Act, both the provisions could be given full effect.
[510F H] 2.2.
While in the case of a scheme under Section 68 C of the old Act, pending on the date of enforcement of the new Act, namely, 1.7.1989, the period of one year as prescribed under Section 100(4) should be computed from the date of commencement of the new Act.
[511D E] 2.3.
The appellant was himself responsible for the delay therefore he is not entitled to complain for the delay.
Delay would not automatically render the scheme illegal.
[500G] 2.4.
Since under the old Act no time frame was pre scribed for finalising a scheme penal consequences could not ensue.
Under the old 503 Act a scheme proposed section 68 could continue to remain in force till it was quashed.
[505G H] 2.5.
Since the scheme proposed on 11.10.1979 had not been quashed by any Court, the same continued to be in force on the date of commencement of the new Act.
In the absence of any provision in the old Act rendering the scheme inef fective on the ground of delay, the scheme proposed section 68 C of the old Act could not lapse ipso facto.
[505H 506A] 2.6.
In the instant case stay order passed by the High Court remained in force from May to 9th August, 1990.
On the exclusion of that period the final Notification issued by the State Government under Section 100(3) of the new Act on 29.8.1990 was well within the prescribed period.

Where there appears to be inconsistency in two sec tions of the same Act, the principle of harmonious construc tion should be followed in avoiding a head on clash.
It should not be lightly assumed that what the Parliament has given with one hand, it took away with the other.
The provi sions of one section of statute cannot be used to defeat those of another unless it is impossible to reconcile the same.
The essence of harmonious construction is to give effect to both the provisions.
