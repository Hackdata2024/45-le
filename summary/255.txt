After the achievement of independence and the coming into force of the new Constitution India became a Sovereign Demo cratio Republic and could not be described as a British Possession or grouped by an Order in Council amongst those Possessions within the meaning of section 12 of the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881.
It became a foreign country so far as other British Possessions &re concerned and the extradition of persons taking asylum in India, having committed offences in British Possessions could only be dealt with by an arrangement between the Sovereign Democratic Republic of India and the British Government and given effect to by appropriate Legislation.
The (Act XV of 1903) has been adapted under the provisions of article 372 of the Constitution but this Act has not kept &live any of the provisions of the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, which was an act of the British Parliament and which has not been adopted and therefore section 12 and section 14 of the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, have no application to India.
