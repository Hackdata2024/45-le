In 1922, the Municipal Committee, Khandwa imposed a tax on the trade of ginning and pressing cotton by means of steam or mechanical process.
Certain suits were filed challenging the validity of the tax and ultimately in 1937, the Privy Council held that the tax had not been validly imposed.
In 1941, the Governor enacted the Khandwa Municipality (Validation of Tax) Act, 1941, which sought to validate the tax imposed in 1922.
In the meantime, section I42 A was introduced in the Government of India Act, 1935, sub section
(2) Of which provided that the 'total amount payable in respect of any one person by way of taxes on professions, trades, callings and employments shall not, after March 31, 1939, exceed Rs. 50 per annum '.
The appellant contended that the validating Act was hit by section 142 A(2) and to the extent that it imposed a tax above Rs. 50 per person per annum it was invalid.
Held, that the Validating Act was not hit by section I42 A (2) Government of India Act, 1935.
The powers of the Indian Legislatures included a power to pass retrospective and validating laws.
Section 142 A(2) which put a limit on the amount of tax did not affect laws relating to a period prior to March 31, 1939, but affected only those relating to periods after that date.
It circumscribed the legislative power by putting a date line after which a tax in excess of Rs. 50 for a period after the dateline could not be collected unless it came within the proviso.
The Validating Act imposed the tax in excess of Rs. 5o not after March 31, 1939, but before it.
