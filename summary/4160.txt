Allowing the Writ Petition, the Court ^ HELD: Under clauses 4 and 5 of Article 22 of the Constitution the detenu has a dual right viz. (i) to have the representation, irrespective of the length of detention, considered by the appropriate Government; and (ii) to have the representation considered by the Board duly constituted under the concerned Act.
[870 E F] Further, the constitutional right to file a representation to the Government carries with it impliedly a right that the representation must be disposed of as quickly as possible and any unexplained delay would amount to a violation of constitutional guarantee contained in Article 22(5).
[870 F G] The obligation of the appropriate detaining authority to take a decision on the representation filed by the detenu is quite apart and distinct from its obligation to constitute a Board and to send the representation to it.
The detaining authority is not entitled to wait for the opinion of the Board but has to take its decision without the least possible delay.
