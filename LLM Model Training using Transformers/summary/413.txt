A Sessions Judge, even if he disagrees with the verdict of the Jury, must normally give effect to that verdict unless he is clearly of opinion that no reasonable body of men could have given the verdict which the Jury did.
Ramnugrah Singh vs King Emperor, ([1946] L.R. 73 I.A. 174), relied on.
A Sessions Judge need not record his reasons for accepting the verdict of the Jury.
In a case where a Judge in his charge to the Jury, has clearly and definitely expressed himself for acquittal, it would be desirable though not imperative, that he should give his reasons why he changed his view and accepted the verdict of the Jury finding the accused guilty.
Even where the examination of the accused under section 342 Cr.
P.C. is perfunctory the judgment cannot be set aside unless clear prejudice is shown.
Tara Singh 's case, ([1951] S.C.R. 729), referred to.
K.C. Mathew and Others vs The State of Travanore Cochin, ([1955] 2 S.C.R. 1057), relied on.
Prejudice cannot be presumed from the fact that the trial is by a jury though that is a circumstance which may be taken into consideration.
An argument which would, if accepted, necessitate a retrial, ought to be put forward at the earliest stage and at any rate before the High Court in appeal and cannot be entertained for the first time in an appeal on special leave.
