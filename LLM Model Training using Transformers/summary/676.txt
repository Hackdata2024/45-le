The Ajmer (Sound Amplifiers Control) Act, 1952, was enacted by the Ajmer Legislative Assembly which, by section 21 Of the , was empowered to make laws for the whole or any part of the State with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List.
The respondents were prosecuted under section 3 Of the Act for breach of the conditions of the permit granted for the use of sound amplifiers.
On a reference under section 432 of the Code of Criminal ' Procedure, the judicial Commissioner of Ajmer held that the Act fell within Entry NO. 31 of the Union List and not within Entry No. 6 of the State List as was claimed by the State, and, therefore, was ultra vires the State Legislature.
Held, that the pith and substance of the impugned Act was the control of the use of amplifiers in the interests of health and also tranquillity and thus the Act was substantially within the powers conferred by Entry No. 6 and conceivably Entry No 1 of the State List, and did not fall within Entry No. 31 of the Union List, even though the amplifier, the use of which is regulated and controlled, is an apparatus for broadcasting or communication.
Accordingly, the Act was intra vires the State Legislature.
