The appellant was held to be an evacuee under section 2(d)(iii) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Ordinance, 1949, and his property was declared to be evacuee property under section 22 (b) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 950, on the ground that he had transferred a substantial portion of his assets to Pakistan.
The relevant portion of section 22(b) runs thus: 372 "If the Custodian is satisfied, after such enquiry as may be prescribed, that the circumstances relating to any person, in respect of whom a declaration has been made on the ground that after the 14th day of August, 1947, and before the 18th day of October, 1949, he has transferred to Pakistan his assets or any part thereof situated in any part of the territories to which this Act extends, are such as may be prescribed as constituting a preparation for his migration to Pakistan, the Custodian may declare any property situated in the State in which such person has any right or interest to be evacuee property. . " The contentions, inter alia, of the appellant were that (1) section 22(b) contravened article 14 of the Constitution and (2) that the circumstances as to the transfer of a substantial portion of his assets should relate to an act done after he was declared as an intending evacuee.
Held, that the two groups of persons who transferred their assets between the 14th August, 1947, and the 18th October, 1949 and persons who transferred their assets after the 18th October, 1949 were not similarly circumstanced and the denial of equal benefits to the two groups was not an infringement of equal protection of laws under article 14 of the Constitution.
The circumstance of transfer of a substantial portion of assets was available for consideration for the purpose of an order under S, 22(b) whether or not the transfer took place before the person was declared as an intending evacuee or afterwards.
