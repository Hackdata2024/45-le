The appellant paid the correct court fee under Section 37(2) of the Madras Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act clearly alleging in para 14 of the plaint that she is in joint possession and is seeking partition and separate possession of her half share in the suit properties as heir of deceased Paramayee.
The preliminary objection as to the correct court fee payable raised and taken up resulted in the final appeal before this court.
Allowing the appeal by Special Leave, the Court ^ HELD: (a) Courts should be anxious to grapple with the real issues and not spend their energies on peripheral ones.
[68H, 69A] (b) Court fee, if it seriously restricts the right of a person to seek his remedies in Courts of justice should be strictly construed.
Since access to justice is the basis of the legal system, where there is a doubt, reasonable of course, the benefit must go to him who says that the lesser court fee alone be paid.
[69A] In the instant case, the court fee that is payable is under s.37(2) of the State Act, which corresponds to article 17 D of the Court Fees & Suits Valuation Central Act, which is the predecessor legislation on the subject.
