The petitioner 's husband transferred certain property to the petitioner.
A notice under section 7, , was issued to the petitioner and to her husband and the husband was declared an evacuee and the property was declared as evacuee property by the Assistant Custodian.
An appeal to the Deputy Custodian and thereafter a revision petition to the Custodian General by the petitioner were dismissed.
The petitioner applied to the Supreme Court under article 32 of the Constitution contending that her fundamental rights under 64 506 articles 19(1)(f) and 31 were infringed by the order of the Assistant Custodian and prayed for the restoration of the property.
Held, that the petition under article 32 was incompetent as no question of violation of any fundamental right arose in the case.
The decision of an authority of competent jurisdiction had negatived the existence of the right alleged by the petitioner and unless that decision was held to be a nullity or could be otherwise got rid of, the petitioner could not complain of any infringement of a fundamental right.
The alleged fundamental right of the petitioner was dependent on whether her husband was an evacuee and whether his property was evacuee property.
The decision on that question had become final and no question of lack of jurisdiction was involved.
