In exercise of the powers under section 3 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, the Central Government made the Cotton Textile (Control of Movement) Order, 1948.
The 1946 Act was to expire on January 26, 1955, but before that, on January 21, 1955, the Essential Commodities Ordinance was promulgated which conferred on the Central Government a power similar to that conferred by section 3 of the 1946 Act.
Section 16 of the Ordinance provided that all Orders made under the 1946 Act in so far as such Orders could be made under the Ordinance shall continue in force and that accordingly any appointment made, license or permit granted or direction issued under any such Order shall continue in force.
The , ,955 by section 16(i)(a) repealed the Ordinance and by section 16(i)(b) 727 repealed any other law in force in any State in so far as such law controlled the production, supply and distribution of, and trade, and commerce in any essential commodity.
The savings clause section 16(2) of the 1955 Act was a repetition of section 16 of the Ordinance.
The respondent contended that the amplitude of the first part of section 16 of the Ordinance was cut down by the second part and consequently section 16 did not save the Order but only the acts done under the Order, and that even if the Order was saved by section 16 of the Ordinance it was repealed by section 16(i)(b) of the 1955 Act and was not continued under that Act.
Held, that the Cotton Textiles (Control of Movement) Order, 1948 was saved by section 16 of the Ordinance and was continued by section 16(2) of the , and was in force on August 30, 1955, when the offence was committed.
The first part of section 16 of the Ordinance saved the order and the acts done under the Order subsequent to the coming into force of the Ordinance and the second part of section 16 saved past acts done under the Order before the coming into force of the Ordinance.
The words " any other law " in section 16(i)(b) of the 1955 Act meant any law other than the Ordinance and an order made or deemed to be made under the Ordinance was not repealed by section 16(i)(b).
Such an order was saved by section 16(i)(a) of the Act.
Held, further, that this was not a fit case for interference under article 136 of the Constitution with the order of the High Court discharging the respondent.
The offence was committed more than four years ago; the application by the appellant to the High Court for a certificate of fitness to appeal to the Supreme Court was belated ; there was plausible justification for the belief of the accused that the Order did not survive the expiry of the 1946 Act in view of the varying views expressed by the Courts; the State filed the appeal presumably to get the legal position clarified ; in such circumstances public interest did not require that the stale matter should be resuscitated.
