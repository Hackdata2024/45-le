The petitioners in Writ Petition 106 of 1980 are working in Group IV Services in various departments of the Government of Andhra Pradesh.
Most of them were appointed after 1974, under the General Rule 10(a)(i)(l) on a purely temporary basis due to the existence of a ban on direct recruitment.
After the lifting of the ban partially special qualifying tests were held for regularising their services in 1974 and 1976.
As they did not put in two years of qualifying service as on 1.1.73 and 1.1.76 respectively, they could not take the said examinations.
In 1976 there was another test conducted by the Public Service Commission wherein about 82000 candidates appeared.
The petitioners did not appear in the said test.
Among the several candidates who were appointed sometimes hl 1977 and 1978 were Respondents 18 to 108.
The petitioners were, however, granted complete exemption from appearing at any examination by GOMS 646 dated 14.7.1979 and the posts held by them were withdrawn from the purview of the Public Service Commission.
Earlier to the said Notification Government issued a memo No. 1806/ Ser B/78 2 Gad dated 25.1.79 proposing to fix inter se seniority between the Public Service Commission candidates who qualified in 1976 and the temporary employees including the petitioners who did not appear at the qualifying test.
Being aggrieved, the Service Commission candidates including respondents 18 to 108 in the Writ Petition, filed R.P. No. 447/79 before the State Administrative Tribunal whose decision went in favour of the Service Commission candidates.
Hence the Civil Appeal No. 2735/86 by the State of Andhra Pradesh.
In both the 508 Writ Petitions and the appeal the question related to the computation of seniority of the Service Commission candidates and the temporary employees whose services were regularised by GOMS 647 dated 14.9.79 after exempting them from passing the qualifying examination etc.
by GOMS 646 dated 14.9.1979.
Dismissing the petition and the appeal, the Court, ^ HELD: l.
The petitioners cannot claim that their seniority should be computed from the respective dates of their appointments after April 1974.
The petitioners were not appointed on a regular basis, but by way of stop gap arrangements to be replaced by the appointment of qualified candidates.
The petitioners failed to avail themselves of the opportunity of qualifying themselves for regular appointments by appearing at the special qualifying test held in 1976, although they.
were eligible for the test.
The Government order being GOMS No. 647 dated September 14, 1979 does not support their claim of seniority from the respective dates of their appointments after April 1974.
Under the said GOMS No. 647, the services of the employees belonging to Group IV services would be regularised from the date of last regular appointment in that category or from the date of temporary appointment, whichever is later and subject to the decision of the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal.
The Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal held that the appointments of the Public Service Commission candidates were regular appointments.
The appointments of the Public Service Commission candidates are, therefore, the last regular appointments as contemplated by GOMS No. 647.
In view of the said decision of the Andhra Pradesh administrative Tribunal and the directions contained in GOMS No. 647, the services of the petitioners will be regularised subsequent to the respective dates of appointments of the respondents Nos.
18 to 108 or the other employees in Group IV services, who were appointed pursuant to their being successful in the special qualifying test held by the Public Service Commission in 1976.
The petitioners have not challenged the said GOMS No. 647; on the contrary, they have placed reliance upon the same and have also prayed for the implementation of the same.
