Section 3 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, provided as follows: (1) The Central Government, so far as it appears to it to be necessary or expedient for maintaining or increasing supplies of an essential commodity, or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices, may by notified order, provide for regulating or prohibiting the production, supply and distribution thereof, and trade and commerce therein.
Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section
(1) an order made thereunder may provide . (j) for any incidental and supplementary matters.
including in particular the entering, and search of premises, vehicles, vessels and aircraft, the seizure by a person authorised to make such search of any articles in respect of which such person has reason to believe that a contravention has been, is being, or is about to be commit ted. " In exercise of the powers conferred on the Central Government by cl.
(j) of sub section
(2) of section (3) of the above said Act, which had been delegated to the Provincial Govern ment in relation to food stuffs, the Governor of Bihar made an order authorising the District Magistrate, Patna, and the Special Officer in charge of rationing, Patna, to search the stock of sugar held by a company of which the appellant was the General Manager and directing the seizure of 5,000 maunds of sugar held in stock by the said company, on the ground that the company was about to commit a contravention of an order of the Chief Controller of Prices and Supplies made under the Sugar and Sugar Products Control 304 Order, 1947.
The appellant obstructed the officers who went to search and seize the goods and was convicted under section 186, Indian Penal Code.
Held, (i) the power "to provide for regulating or prohib iting production, supply and distribution" conferred by the Act on the Central Government included the power to regu late or prohibit by issuing directions to a particular producer or dealer or by requiring any specific act to be done or foreborne in regard to production etc., and the order of the Governor was not therefore invalid on the ground that it was not a rule or regulation of general application but an order concerning a particular company alone; (ii) sub section (2) of section 3 conferred no further or other powers than what were conferred by sub section
(1) and the enumeration of certain matters in sub section
(2) was merely illustrative, as such enumeration was "without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section
(1) "; (iii) seizure of an article being within the purview of sub section
(1) of section 3 it was therefore competent to the Cen tral Government, and its delegate the Provincial Government, to make an order for seizure under sub section
(1) apart from and irrespective of the anticipated contravention of any other order as contemplated in el.
(j) of sub section (2); (iv) even assuming that the order of the Chief Control ler of Prices under the Sugar Control Order was incomplete and inoperative and there could be no question of its con travention, the reference to that order in the order made by the Governor would be a mere redundancy and would not affect the validity of the latter order, and the appellant was rightly convicted under section 186, Penal Code.
Quaere: Whether for an offence under section 186, Penal Code, it is necessary that the act which was obstructed must be duly authorised and otherwise lawful.
