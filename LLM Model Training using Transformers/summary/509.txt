Section 11( 1) of the U. P. Agricultural Income tax Act, 1948, provided: "Where any person holds land, from which agricultural income is derived, as a common manager appointed under any law for the time being in force or under any agreement or as receiver, administrator or the like on behalf of persons jointly interested in such land or in the agricultural income derived therefrom, the aggregate of the sums payable as agricultural income tax by each person on the agricultural income derived from such land and received by him, shall be assessed on such common manager, receiver, administrator or the like, and he shall be deemed to be the assessee in respect of the agricultural income tax so payable by each such person and shall be liable to pay the same.
" The appellants were the trustees of an estate settled on trust under a will which inter alia provided that the trustees were to take possession of the trust properties and to manage the same with all the powers of absolute owners and to pay the annuities to certain persons.
The assessing authority assessed the appellants to agricultural income tax upon the total agricultural income received by them, overruling their contention that the tax should be computed in accordance with the method of computation laid down in section 11(1) of the Act and that they should be called upon to pay the aggregate of the sums payable as agricultural income tax by each of the annuitants.
Held: (1) that the trustees who were the legal owners of the trust property did not hold the land from which agricultural income was derived, on behalf of the annuitants and that each of the annuitants was separately or individually interested in the agricultural income derived from the land comprised in the trust estate to the extent of the annuity payable to him.
(2) that section 11(1) of the Act was not applicable to the case and that the appellants were liable to pay agricultural income tax upon the total agricultural income received by them
