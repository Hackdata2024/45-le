The respondent was a registered dealer under the Assam Sales Tax Act, 1947.
The Sales tax Officer assessed the respondent to Sales tax in respect of the containers of hydrogenated oil and other exempted goods.
Appeals to the Assistant Commissioner of Taxes failed as also second ap peals to the Assam Board of Revenue.
In reference the High Court held that the value of the containers was not assessable to sales tax "unless separate price has been charged for the containers.
" This finding was based on the view that there was no evidence to show that actually separate price was paid for the containers and hence there was no sale and there could not be any tax on the containers.
In appeal to this Court by the Commissioner of Taxes it was urged that the parties may have intended in the circumstances to sell the hydrogenated oil apart from the containers the mere fact that the price of the containers was not separately fixed would make no difference HELD : The question as to whether there is an agreement to sell packing material is a pure question of fact depending upon the circumstances found in each case.
The High Court was in error when it answered the question of law referred to it without addressing itself to the question whether there was an express or implied agreement for the sale of the containers of hydrogenated oil in the present case.
