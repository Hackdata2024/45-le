The last day for filing the election petition was a Sunday and the day following was a public holiday.
The petition was presented on the next day after the public holiday.
Held, that section 10 of the General Clauses Act was applicable and that the petition was presented within time.
The appellant, who retains a large staff of subordinates, was charged with employing 54 of them for purposes of the election in violation of Rule 118, and with failure to include their salaries in the return of his election expenses.
The election tribunal found that 25 of the old paid employees of the appellant took part in his election campaign, that their number exceeded the statutory number provided by Rule 118 and that consequently the appellant was guilty of a major corrupt practice under section 123 (7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
The tribunal further held that there was no evidence to show that the employees were engaged specifically for the purposes of the election, that they had been in the service of the appellant for a long time and that the emoluments paid to them were not election expenses.
In the result the tribunal set aside the election of the appellant: Held, that where a person has been in the employment of a candidate even prior to his election and his duties do not include election work but he takes part in the election, and the work which he does is casual and is in addition to his normal work, he is not within Rule 118.
But if the work in connection with the election is such that he could be regarded as having been taken out of his normal work and put on election work, then he would be within Rule 118.
Hartlepooles Case, and Borough of Oxford Case, , referred to.
If the members of the staff of a candidate do their normal work and do casual work in connection with the election, the payment of salary to them would be payment on account of their 209 employment as such members of the staff and not in connec tion with the election.
