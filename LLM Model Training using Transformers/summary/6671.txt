Under the West Bengal Entertainments and Luxuries (Hotels and Restaurents) Tax Act, 1972 as amended in 1974, the appellants were called upon to make ad hoc payment of luxury tax calculated at Rs.2,40,000.
A representation from the Hotel Association to the Respondents having being turned down, the appellants filed Writ Petition before the High Court, challenging the constitutional validity of the Act.
The Writ Petition was dismissed by a Single Judge.
On appeal, the Division Bench declined to interfere holding that there was no dicrimination, and thus there was no violation of Article 14 of the Constitution.
Aggrieved, the appellants preferred the present appeal.
Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1.
The Luxury Tax charged under Section 4 of the West Bengal Entertainments and Luxuries (Hotels and Restaurants) Tax Act, 1972, is not discriminatory and is constitutionally valid for the reasons stated in the judgment of this Court in a similar matter wherein the same contentions were urged.
