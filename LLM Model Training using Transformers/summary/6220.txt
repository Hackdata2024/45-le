Paragraph 17.3 of Chapter 17, Part II of the Report of the Fourth Central Pay Commission entitled Government em ployees retiring during the period January 1, 1986 to Sep tember 30, 1986 to consideration of the entire dearness allowance drawn by them upto December 31, 1985 as pay for pensionary benefits.
Rule 5(2) of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 permits the day on which a Government servant retires from service to be treated as his last working day.
The proviso thereto, however, states that in the case of a Government servant who retires voluntarily under Rule 48 A the date of retirement shall be treated as a non working day.
The petitioner was permitted to retire voluntarily from the service of the Registry of the Supreme Court under the provisions of Rule 48 A of the Rules with effect from the forenoon of January 1, 1986 by an order dated December 6, 1985.
His claim to the benefit of paragraph 17.3 was not acceded to.
In the writ petition it was contended for the respond ents that as in view of the proviso to rule 5(2) of the Rules the petitioner was not entitled to the salary for the day of his retirement, he was not entitled to the benefit of paragraph 17.3.
Allowing the writ petition, HELD: Under paragraph 17.3 of Chapter 17, Part II of the Report of the Fourth Central Pay Commission the benefits recommended will be available to employees retiring during the period, January 1, 1986 to September 30, 1986.
In the instant case, the petitioner was permitted to retire volun tarily from the service of the 563 Registry of the Supreme Court with effect from the forenoon of January 1, 1986.
The fact that under the proviso to rule 5(2) of the Rules, the petitioner will not be entitled to any salary for the day on which he actually retired has no bearing on the question as to the date of retirement.
The petitioner could not be said to have retired on December 31, 1985.
It has then to be said that he had retired with effect from January 1, 1986 and that is also the order of this Court dated December 6, 1985.
He, therefore, comes within the purview of paragraph 17.3 of the recommendations of the Pay Commission.
[565A E] The respondents to calculate and pay to the petitioner within three months his pension in accordance with the recommendation of the Pay Commission as contained in para graph 17.3.
