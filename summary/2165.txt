The suit of the appellant as khatedar of the land in dispute, for ejectment of the respondents on the ground that they were shikmi tenants, was decreed by the Tahsildar under section 71 of the Bhopal State Land Revenue Act, 1932.
Within 12 years of the date of their dispossession the respondents filed the suit against the appellant in the civil court, claiming to be the khatedars and for possession.
The lower courts and the High Court held that the decision of the revenue court did not bar the jurisdiction of the civil court on the question of title to the suit land and decreed the suit.
In appeal to this Court, HELD : Section 200(1) of the Act, read with sections 71, 89, 93 and 95, does not exclude the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain a suit based on title.
[621 E F] Section, 200(1) bars the civil court from entertaining a suit with respect to any matter which a revenue officer is empowered by the Act to determine.
But the question of title is a matter foreign to the scope of section 71.
The Tahsildar is no doubt empowered under section 93 to decide on any dispute about any entry to be made in the Record of rights showing the persons who are holders of land, but, under section 95, the effect of such an entry is only to make it a presumptive piece of evidence in a collateral proceeding such as a suit based on title.
Therefore, it is assumed that such a suit could be filed in spite of a decision under section 93.
The suit was within time under article 142, Limitation Act, 1908, and since the High Court and the lower courts held that the presumption raised by the entry was rebutted by the oral and documentary evidence adduced by the res pondents, the correctness of the concurrent findings of fact could not be canvassed in the appeal under article 136.
