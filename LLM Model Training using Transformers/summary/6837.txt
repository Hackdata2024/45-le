On its memorandum of appeal, the plaintiff had paid the same amount of court fee.
Respondents asked for dismissal of the memorandum of appeal as it had not been sufficiently stamped.
The Additional District Judge dismissed the memorandum of appeal.
The High Court did not interfere, when plaintiff took the matter before it.
Hence this appeal by special leave by the plaintiff contending that the learned Additional District Judge in stead of dismissing the memorandum of appeal, an opportunity should have been given and the appellant should have been called upon to make good the deficiency.
Allowing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1.
