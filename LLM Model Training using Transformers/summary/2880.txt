The appellants purchased certain lands and filed a suit against the respondent, who was the tenant at will under the vendor, for ejectment The suit was decreed.
The appellants entered into possession and the tenancy of the respondent was determined.
Thereafter, the respondent filed a suit for possession by pre emption under section 15(1) (a) Fourthly of the Punjab Pre emption Act, 1913 which provides that a right of preemption vests in a tenant who holds, under tenancy of the vendor the land or property sold or a part thereof.
It was contended that it was sufficient if the plaintiff proved that he was a tenant under the vendor ,on the date of the sale.
HELD: The well established principle being that a pre emptor must maintain his qualification to preempt upto the date of the decree for possession by pre emption, the Legislature cannot be attributed the intention of giving the tight to a tenant who has been dispossessed and whose tenancy has been determined either before or during the pendency of his suit, claiming the right of pre emption.
This is particularly so as the statutory right of presumption is one which attaches to the land and is not a mere personal right.
