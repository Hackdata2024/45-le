The respondent landlord filed a suit for eviction against the appellant under section 13 (1) (k) of the Delhi and Ajmer Rent Control Act, 1952, on the ground that the appellant had caused damage to the premises.
The trial court ordered ejectment in February, 1959, and the appellate authority dismissed an appeal in November, 1959.
The Delhi Rent Control Act 1958 came into force in February, 1959.
In a revision application before the High Court, the appellant invoked the provisions of the 1958 Act and relied upon section 14(1) (j) read with section 57 of the new Act.
The High Court, acting under section 14(1)(j) and sub section (10) of the same section gave the appellant the alternative to pay compensation for the damages caused.
The landlord then filed an application for review of the High Court order pointing out that the new Act was not applicable to the case in view of the first proviso of section 57(2).
The High Court granted the review and reversed its earlier orders.
In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that by virtue of the first proviso of section 57(2) the High Court was bound to have regard to the provisions of the 1958 Act even in proceedings pending and governed by the 1952 Act.
HELD:Dismissing the appeal, The language of the first proviso to section 57(2) clearly shows that the proviso applies to those cases only in which 'Section 54 cannot be made applicable.
The area in the present case is admittedly subjected to the , which is one of the enactments mentioned in section 54.
Accordingly the terms of the proviso would have no application in this case.
[857 G; 859 B] The High Court had rightly held that the phrase "to which section 54 does not apply", governs the word "premises" and is not connected with the words "in any such suit or proceedings".
