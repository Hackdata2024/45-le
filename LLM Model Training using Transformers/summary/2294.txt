The appellant 's application for variation of a route extending beyond 24 kilometers was accepted by the Regional Transport Authority.
The respondent, who had unsuccessfully objected before the Authority filed a writ petition in the High Court to quash the order.
The High Court accepted the writ petition holding that any variation in excess of 24 kilometers was ex facie illegal and violation of the intendment of the legislature enacting Madras Act 3 of 1964.
which amended the Motor Vehicles Act.
In appeals this Court, HELD : The Regional Transport Authority had authority under r. 208 to vary the permit and nothing contained in section 48(3)(xxi) of the Motor Vehicles Act limited its power in respect of the distance covered by the variation in this case.
[19A] Section 5(1) of Madras Act 3 of 1964 made the route or routes or the area specified in every stage carriage permit granted before the commencement of the Amending Act a condition attached to such permit tinder sub section
(3) of section 48 of the Principal Act; it did not that section 48(3)(xxi) shall be deemed to be condition attached to every such permit.
[18c] The High Court erred in holding that section 48(3)(xxi) of the Act, is amended.
by itself gave power to the Regional Transport Authority to vary the route within certain limits.
This power Could be exercised only if a condition to that effect was put in the permit.
In the case of the appellant the permit contained a condition similar to the condition mentioned in section 48 (3) (xxi) before its amendment by Act 3 of f 964.
Therefore, for the purpose of this appeal section 48(3)(xxi).
is amendment has to be treated ,is non existent.
