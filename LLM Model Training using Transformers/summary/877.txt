The appellant 's manager was violently attacked by its workmen as a result of which he sustained serious injuries.
The workers in the lower division also threatened the appellant 's staff working in that division that they would murder them if they worked there.
The appellant was therefore compelled to notify that the division would be closed until further notice.
Subsequently as a result of conciliation before the labour officer, the division was opened again.
The workers made a claim for lay off compensation under section 25C of the , for the period during which the lower division was closed on the footing that the management for their own reasons did not choose to run the division during that period.
The appellant 's answer was, inter alia, that the closure of the division amounted to a lock out which under the circumstances was perfectly justified and as such the workers were not entitled to claim any lay off compensation: Held ; (1) that the concept of a lock out is essentially different from that of a lay off and where the closure of business amounts to a lock out under section 2(1) of the , 372 it would be impossible to bring it within the scope of a lay off under section 2 (kkk) of the Act.
(2)that the expression " any other reason " in section 2 (kkk) means any reason which is allied or analogous to reasons already specified in that section.
J. K. Hosiery Factory vs Labour Appellate Tribunal of India Anr, A.I.R. 1956 All. 498, approved.
(3) that the lock out which was justified on the facts of the case, was not a lay off and therefore the workmen were not entitled to claim any lay off compensation.
