The assessee, a partnership firm, enjoyed the status of a registered firm for the assessment years 1960 61, 1961 62 and 1962 63.
In the assessment proceedings for the year 1962 63 the assessee claimed that a loss of Rs.60,054 suf fered in the speculation business in the assessment year 1960 61 and the loss of Rs.6,839 suffered in the assessment year 1961 62 should be set off against the speculation profit of Rs.58,102 for the assessment year 1962 63.
The Income Tax Officer rejected the assessee 's claim holding that as the assessee was a registered firm, the losses could be carried forward and set off only by the partners and not by the firm.
The appeal by the assessee before the Assistant Appellate Commissioner was dismissed.
In the appeal to the Tribunal, the Tribunal held that the right to carry forward the losses relating to the as sessment years 1960 61 and 1961 62 was governed by the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 and that section 75(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 which was applicable to the assessment year 1960 61 had no application in the facts of this case; that when an Act was passed repealing an earlier enactment, it could not be said to supersede any right already accrued under the repealed enactment unless there was something in the repealing Act to indicate that clearly and, therefore, the assessee was entitled to have the losses brought forward from the preceding two years and set off against the profits earned for the year 1962 63.
In the Reference, the High Court held: (1) that a right had 943 accrued to the assessee by virtue of 1922 Act which entitled him to have the losses from speculation business in respect of the assessment year 1960 61 and 1961 62 to be carried forward and set off against the profits in speculation business of future years; (2) that was a right which had accrued to it before the 1961 Act was brought into force; (3) that by virtue of section 6 of the General Clauses Act that right continued to subsist and (4) that the Tribunal was right in holding that the assessee was entitled to set off the speculation losses suffered in the assessment years 1960 61 and 1961 62 against the speculation profits of the assessment year 1962 63.
Dismissing the Appeal of the Revenue, HELD: 1.

vs Haji Gulam Mohamad & Haji Dada Trust, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 720 at 723, referred to.
Under the Income Tax Act of 1922, the assessee was entitled to carry forward the losses of the speculation business and set off such losses against profits made from that business in future years.
The right of carrying forward and set off accrued to the assessee under the Act of 1922.
A right which had accrued and had become vested continued to be capable of being enforced notwithstanding the repeal of the statute under which that right accrued unless the re pealing statute took away such right expressly or by neces sary implication.
This is the effect of section 6 of the .
[951B D] 4.
Whatever rights are expressly saved by the 'savings ' provision stand saved.
But, that does not mean that rights which are not saved by the 'saving ' provision are extin guished or stand ipso facto terminated by the mere fact that a new statute repealing the old statute is enacted.
Rights which have accrued are saved unless they are taken away expressly.
This is the principle behind section 6(c) of the .
[951E F] 944 5.
The right to carry forward losses which had ac crued under the repealed Income Tax Act of 1922 is not saved expressly by section 297 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
But it is not necessary to save a right expressly in order to keep it alive after the repeal of the Old Act of 1922.
Section 6(c) of the saves accrued rights unless they are taken away by the repealing statute.
Taking away of any such rights by section 297 either expressly or by implication is not found.
