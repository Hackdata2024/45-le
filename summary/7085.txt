The appellant in Civil Appeal No.481 of 1983, and thousands of other families, known as Chakmas, migrated from the erstwhile East Pakistan to Assam where they were given shelter as refugees in 1964.
In the year 1966 the Government drew up the Chakma resettlement Schemes whereunder they were allotted lands within the North East Frontier Agency, which later became State of Arunachal Pradesh.
The appellant and 56 other Chakma families strayed away from the original settlement area and negotiated with the local Raja who through an unregistered deed donated land to them inside the inner line which was a protected area under the Foreigners ' Protection Area Order 1958.
Later, the State Govenment received complaints that the 402 Chakmas were making encroachment on lands of local people, indulging in illegal collection of arms and ammunition and establishing contacts with the extremist groups.
An inquiry into the matter was directed.
The Government found it necessary to shift them, and by order dated 15.2.1984 directed the appellant and the other Chakma families to vacate the land and to shift to the original settlementarea where other Chakma families were already` residing.
