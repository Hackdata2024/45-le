The appellant was a candidate for Election to the Lok Sabha in the General Elections.
Respondent 1 was declared the successful candidate.
The appellant filed Election Petition under Section 81 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
The appellant expressly stated in his Election Petition that security amount of Rs. 2,000/ was being deposited along with the petition as required by section 117 of the Act but, in fact, no such deposit was made.
The High Court dismissed the petition for non compliance with the provisions of section 117.
On Appeal to this Court, the appellant argued that sections 86 and 117 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 are ultra vires Article 329(b) of the Constitution and, therefore, the High Court was in error in dismissing the election petition for non compliance of section 117.
Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: (1) The Constitution by Article 329(b), has conferred authority on the appropriate legislature to pass a law providing for the authority to which the election petition may be presented and the manner of providing it.
The provision of law which prescribes that an election petition shall be accompanied by the payment of security amount pertains to the area covered by the manner of the making of the election petition and is, therefore, within the authority of the Parliament.
[143 G H] (2) The question as to what is the consequence of non compliance with section 117 of the Act has been settled by the decision of this Court in Charan Lal Sahu vs Nand Kishore Bhatt and Others ; [144 A] (3) The High Court was right in dismissing the election petition summarily in view of section 86(1) of the Act.
