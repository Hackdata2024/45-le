The draft standing orders submitted by the appellants to the certifying officer for certification under section 3(1) Of the , were altered by the latter on the footing that the modifications were necessary so as to be in conformity with the model standing orders.
Section 4 Of the Act, before it was amended in 1956, provided that "it shall not be the function of the certifying officer or the appellate authority to adjudicate upon the fairness or reasonableness of the provisions of any standing order," while under section 3(2) the draft shall be, as far as is practicable, in conformity with the model standing orders, where they have been prescribed.
The question was whether the certifying officer had jurisdiction to make the modifications in the present case.
Held, that there is a distinction between considerations of fairness or reasonableness and those of practicability, and that though the certifying officer may not modify the draft on the ground that its provisions are unfair or unreasonable, he can and must modify it in matters covered by the model standing 975 orders if he is satisfied that conformity with such model standing orders is practicable in the circumstances of the case.
