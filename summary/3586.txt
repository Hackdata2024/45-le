The appellant, a cashier in a rural block development office of Shahjahanpur district, was convicted for misappro priating public money.
Both the courts concurrently found that he had pocketed the sum which he claimed to have paid the Panchayat Secretary as salary.
The appellant contended that the charge against him was falsified by the voucher and regular entry of the cash register regarding the above payment, which had been ticked and initialled by the Block Development Officer, and pro duced in evidence.
Allowing the appeal, the Court HELD: (1) The proposition of litigative finality at the High Court level on findings of fact has been affirmed by this Court, but the exceptions which prove the rule are also well established.
A conviction of guilt has been rendered by both the Courts, but certain grave factors conducive to miscarriage of justice, induce us to make an exception.
The accused is entitled to the benefit of reasonable doubt owing to the contemporaneous entry in the cash register coupled with the signature of the B.D.O. the same day, as against ipsi dixit later.
[689 G, 691 H, 692 G H] (2) Our observations must serve as catalysts to crash strategies on white collar crimes.
Gross negligence, even absent mens rea, in handling public funds by those in office must hold penal consequences as it inflicts double injury on the poor masses.
[694 G H]
