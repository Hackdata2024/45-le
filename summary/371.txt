No question of infringement of any fundamental right under article 21 arises where the detention complained of is by a private person and not by, a State or under the authority or orders of a State, and the Supreme Court will not, therefore, entertain an application for a writ of have a corpus, under article 32 of the Constitution.
Consequently a petition under article 32 of the Constitution for a writ of habeas corpus founded on article 21 and directed against a father for alleged detention of his daughter does not lie.
A. K. Gopalan vs The State of Madras ([1950] S.C.R. 88) and P. D Shamdasani vs Central Bank of India ([1952] S.C.R. 391), relied on.
