section 7 of the Punjab Customs (Power to Contest) Act, 1920 provided that no person shall contest any alienation of non ancestral immovable property on the ground that such alienation is contrary to custom.

A gift deed was executed by one Mula, in favour of appellant No. 13 Bhagwati Deyi, on December 3, 1964.
Appel lants 1 to 12 claiming to be potential reversioners obtained a decree on May 31, 1966 in a suit flied against the donor and the donee for a declaration that under the Punjab Cus toms (Power to Contest) Act Z of 1920 the gift deed was not binding on them and that decree was confirmed in appeal on October 16, 1967.
On July 10, 1966, Mula adopted the re spondent.
On March 11, 1970 appellant No. 13 executed in favour of appellants 1 to 12,, a lease in respect of the property which was the subject matter of the gift.
Mula died on August 23, 1971.
On December 13, 1971, respondent filed a suit for possession of certain properties including the property which Mula had gifted to appellant No. 13.
The suit was decreed on January 20, 1971 and that decree was confirmed in appeal by the District Court and the High Court.
In appeal by special leave.
, the appellants contended (i) In decreeing the suit the Courts below had over looked the relevant provisions of the Punjab Customs (Power to Contest) Amendment Act, 1973 by virtue of which the legali ty of the gift made by Mula to appellant No. 13 could not be contested and (ii) since the respondent was not entitled to impeach the gift in favour of Bhagwati Devi, having been adopted after the date of the gift, the decree obtained by appellants 1 to 12 cannot enure for his benefit, under section 8 of the Punjab Limitation (Custom) Act, of 1920.
Dismissing the appeal, the Court HELD: (1 ) That a declaratory decree obtained under the Punjab Customs (Power to Contest) Act by a reversioner to the effect that an alienation would not bind them after the.
alienor 's death, had the effect of restoring the property alienated to the estate of the alienor and therefore, all persons who are heirs to the deceased were entitled to obtain possession of the alienated property.
[367 E F] (ii) The decree obtained by appellants 1 to 12 on May 31, 1966 would enure for the benefit of all persons who are entitled to a share in the property of the.
deceased as it existed at the moment of his death.
Since Mula 's property stood freed from the encumbrance of the, gift at the moment of his death, respondent as the adopted son would be en tiled to the possession of the gifted property.
[367 H, 368 A] Giani Ram vs Ramji Lal ; , relied on to; Chand Singh vs bid Kaur approved.
(iii) It is true that, if it became necessary after the amending Act of 1973 to contest the gift executed by Mula in favour of Bhagwati Devi, section 7 of the Act of 1920 would operate as a bar to such a contest.
But in the instant case, the basis on which the respondent has asked for the relief is that upon the death of Mula in 1971, the gift ceased to be operative by reason of the decree passed in suit No. 143/1965.
He has not and indeed he need not have contested the validity of the gift deed since the question was decided finally in the aforesaid suit.
