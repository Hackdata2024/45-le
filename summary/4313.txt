Dismissing the special leave petition, the Court ^ HELD: 1.
Mere lexical legalism cannot sterilise the sensible humanism writ large on section 51(2)(x).

[1025G] 2.
Section 51(2) of the , is geared to public safety, not private profit and casts a solemn duty not to be deterred by any pressure except the pressure of social justice to Indian lives moving in buses, walking on roads or even standing on margins.
If the top killer road accident is to be awarded death sentence, section 51 and like provisions must receive severe enforcement.
In this spirit although backtracking from 4 year old models to 7 year old models the state imposed condition 18.
Section 51(2) (x) authorises the impost of "any condition" of course having a nexus with the statutory purpose.
Human safety is one such purpose.
[1025D F, H] 3.
From the point of view of the human rights of road users, the condition regarding the model of the permitted bus is within jurisdiction and not to prescribed such safety clauses is abdication of statutory duty.
There is no conflict between a vehicle being fit to ride and the condition as an additional requirement and safety factor in the shape of the year and the model.
This is an extra measure, a further insurance against machine failure and cannot contradict the 'fitness ' provision.
