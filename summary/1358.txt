An arbitration agreement was filed in court under section 20 of the , and an order of reference was made thereon.
The arbitrator entered upon the reference and in due course filed his award in court.
The award was however, unstamped and on objection raised that no judgment 476 could be passed on such an award, the trial court passed an order remitting the award to the arbitrator for re submitting it to the court on duly stamped paper.
The High Court took the view that want of stamp would be an illegality apparent on the face of the award, which could therefore be remitted under section 16(1) (c) of the Act. ^ Held, that all unstamped award cannot be remitted under section 16(1) (c) of the , to the arbitrator to get it stamped, because want of stamp is a defect dehors the award or the decision of the arbitrator and does not amount to an illegality apparent upon the face of it within the meaning of that section.
Ramkumar vs Kushalchand, A.I.R. 1928 Nag.
166 and Lakshmichand vs Kalloolal, 1956 N.L.J. 504, disapproved.
Nani Bala Saha vs Ram Gopal Saha, A.I.R. 1945 Cal.
19, approved.
Held, further, that after making an award the arbitrator is functus officio, and section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot therefore give the court power to direct the arbitrator to make a fresh award and re submit it after writing it on proper stamp paper.
Mordue vs Palmer, , relied on.
Dubitante, it is doubtful if the fees and charges mentioned in section 14(1) of the Arbitration act, 1940, include the stamp duty payable on the award.
