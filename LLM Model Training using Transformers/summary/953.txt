The appellants, who were carrying on the business of com mission agents in forward contracts, filed a petition before the High Court of Punjab under article 226 of the Constitution of India challenging the validity of the Punjab Forward Contracts Tax Act, 1951, on the ground that it was ultra vires the powers conferred upon the State Legislature.
The Act provided for the levy of a tax on forward contracts which were defined, by.
section 2, as agreements, oral or written, for sale of goods on a future date but on the basis of which actual delivery of goods was not made or taken but only the difference between the price of the goods agreed upon and that prevailing on the date mentioned in the agreement or any other date was paid or received by the parties.
The High Court took the view that the Act was one to tax speculation in futures and fell within Entry 62 of the State List as an Act to impose taxes on betting and gambling.
Held, that as the definition of the expression " forward contract " in the Punjab Forward Contracts Tax Act, 1951, does not set out all the elements which are necessary to render a contract a wagering contract the legislature could not be considered to have contemplated wagering contracts in defining " forward contracts " in the way it did.
The Act therefore does not fall within Entry 62, List II, Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, and is beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature.
Held, further, that even if the definition could be considered to be wide, enough to include certain contracts which may be wagering contracts because of the fact that the parties to the contract had no intention to deliver the goods, the portion of the Act which would then be valid is so thin and truncated that the entire Act should be held invalid.
