Section 18 of the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956, provides for two classes of cases namely, (1) those coming under sections 3 or 7 as well as under section 18, and (2) those coming only under section 18.
Sections 3 and 7 provide for the punishment of persons guilty of the offences mentioned therein after a regular trial, with a right of appeal.
Section 18 is a preventive measure, dealing with premises, and is intended to minimise the chance of a brothel being run near a public place, and provides for a summary enquiry.

In the present case, on the strength of reports submitted by the police to him, the Sub Divisional Magistrate passed orders under section 18 (1) with respect to certain premises in the occupation of the respondents.
They challenged the validity of the section, and the High Court held that the section violated article 14 of the Constitution.
In appeal to this Court, Held,: Section 18 provides for two distinct classes of cases and the classification being reasonable is not violative of article 14 of the Constitution.
But the proceedings taken by the Magistrate not being in accordance with law should be set aside.
The reports disclosed a cognizable offence under section 3 of the Act and in such a case, the Magistrate cannot ignore the cognizable offence and merely have recourse to section 18, thus depriving parties of the benefit of a trial and appeal.
The, Magistrate should have taken action under section 190 (1) (b) of the Criminal Procedure Code after investigation by such police officer as is mentioned in section 13 of the Act, and it was only after the disposal of the cases against the parties that action could be taken under section 18 if there was occasion for it.
