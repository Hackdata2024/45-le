A case was initiated through a report lodged with the police on the 9th April, 1960 that the respondent 's firm had misappropriated a large quantity of G. C. Sheets meant for distribution to quota and sub quota holders.
After investigation, a police report was submitted on the 23rd December 1962 to the Magistrate, who took cognizance of the case on the 25th January, 1963.
Charges were framed against the respondents under section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act on 15th September, 1967.
The progress of the case thereafter was very tardy.
In 1979, the respondents made two applications to the High Court for quashing the proceedings initiated against them.
The High Court allowed them on the ground that the police report did not disclose any offence against any of the respondents and that as the prosecution commenced in the year 1963 was still going on in 1979, it would be an abuse of the process of the Court to allow the prosecution to continue any further.
In the appeal by the State to this Court, it was contended that the finding about the police report not disclosing any offence was erroneous and that the delay in the conclusion of the trial was not a justification for quashing the proceedings.
Dismissing the appeal ^ HELD: 1.
There has to be a limit to the period for which criminal litigation is allowed to go on at the trial stage.
[404D] 2.
The present case is not a proper one for interference inspite of the fact that the allegations disclose the commission of an offence which is quite serious.
[404E] In the instant case the trial has not made much headway even though no less than 20 years have gone by.
Such protraction itself means considerable harassment to the accused not only monetarily but also by way of constant attention to the case and repeated appearances in court, apart from anxiety.
