All the above sentences were to run concurrently.
Against this judgment and order 3 criminal appeals being Criminal Appeal Nos.
159/1976, 168/1976 and 169/1976 were filed.
These criminal appeals along with R.T. No. 2 of 1976 were heard by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad and the learned Judge by his order dated 5th May, 1976 acquitted all the accused of both the charges of rioting and murder levelled 330 against them and set aside the convictions and sentences allowing all the appeals and rejecting the reference.
It is against this judgment and order the instant appeal on special leave was filed before this court by the State.
This court granted special leave to appeal by its order dated 11.1.1978 and also ordered issue of bailable warrants against each of the accused persons in the sum of Rs.10,000 with one surety to the satisfaction of Additional Sessions Judge, Eluru.
We have heard the learned counsel for both the parties and we are constrained to hold that the judgment passed by the High Court acquitting all the accused is not a proper judgment in accordance with the provisions of Section 354 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973.
The learned Judge has not at all considered and marshalled the evidences examined on behalf of the prosecution particularly the evidences of PWs 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 who were eye witnesses to the gruesome murder committed in the morning at about 7.30 a.m.
The names of all the 7 accused appeared in the F.I.R. lodged by PW 2 in the Police Station at 9.30 a.m., exhibit PI and exhibit P.23 and P.24 dated 23.7.1974.
The learned Judge did not formulate properly the points for decision and did not marshal the evidences on record and did not come to specific finding on each of the points for determination by recording specific reasons for arriving at the decision.
It is really unfortu nate that the learned Judge approached the case from wrong angle and without properly formulating the points for deci sion and without any proper appraisal of the evidences adduced by the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused persons and also without adverting to the reasonings of the Sessions Judge, has perfunctorily come to the finding that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond doubt the case against the accused even though there are eye witnesses P.Ws. 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 to the occurence.
In our considered opinion, this judgment is not in accordance with the mandatory requirements as laid down in Section 354 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
We therefore, set aside the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and remit the ease back to the High Court, Andhra Pradesh for deciding the case in accord ance with law on a proper appraisal and marshalling of the evidences on record as early as possible.
The order of interim stay is vacated and bail bonds are cancelled.
The records be sent to the High Court forthwith.
The High Court will be free to consider whether the accused will be en larged on bail.
