The Himachal Pradesh Abolition of Big Landed Estates and Land Reforms Act, 1953, lays down a scheme for the abolition of proprietary rights of landowners: (1) under section 11 there would be a direct transfer of the rights of a landowner from the landowner to the occupancy tenant; (2) under section 15, in respect of lands situate in an area specified by Government, there would be a transfer to the State Government, the tenants of such lands becoming the tenants of the Government; and (3) under section 27, in the case of large holdings the ownership would be first transferred to the State Government and thereafter by the State Government in favour of the tenant.
The respondent made an application under section 11 of the Act for acquiring proprietary rights in certain lands as he was the occupancy tenant of those lands, the Union of India being the landowner.
On the question whether the Act was intended to affect land owned orheld by the Union or State Government, HELD:There is nothing in the provisions of the Act suggesting,expresslyor by necessary implication that the Act was not applicable to the State, or any distinction between lands owned and held by citizens and lands owned and held by the State.
[454C] The object of the Act was to abolish big landed estates and alleviate the conditions of occupancy tenants by abolishing the proprietary rights of landowners in them and vesting such rights in the tenants.
If discrimination between the State and the citizen in the matter of the application of the Act is made it would result in the anomaly that whereas occupancy tenants of lands owned by citizens would have the benefit of such a beneficent legislation, occupancy tenants of lands owned and held by the State would not get such benefit.
An intention to bring about such a discrimination cannot be attributed to the legislature whose avowed object was to do away, in the interest of social and economic justice, landlordism in the State.
