Once it is hold that a possession of a co sharer has become adverse to the other co sharer as a result of ouster, the mere assertion of his joint title by the dispossessed co sharer would not interrupt the running of adverse possession.
He must actually and effectively break up the exclusive possession of his co sharer by re entry upon the property or by resuming possession in such manner as it was possible to do.
It may also check the running of time if the co sharer who is in exclusive possession acknowledges the title of his co owner or discontinues his exclusive possession of the property.
The fact that one co sharer who bad allowed himself to be dispossessed by another co sharer as a result of ouster exhibited later on his animus to treat the property as the joint property of himself and his co sharer cannot arrest the running of adverse possession in favour of the co sharer.
A mere mental act on the part of the person dispossessed unaccompanied by any change of possession cannot affect the continuity of adverse possession of the deseizor.
