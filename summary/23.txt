Section 3 (1) of the Patiala and East Punjab States Union General Provisions (Administration) Ordinance (No. XVI of 2005) which came into force on February 2, 1949, and re enacted section 3 of an earlier Ordinance which was in force from August 20, 1948, provided that as from the appointed day (i.e., August 20, 1948) all laws in force in the Patiala State shall apply muutatis mutandis to 17 128 the territories of the said Union, provided that all pro ceedings pending before courts and other authorities of any of the Covenanting States shall be disposed of in accordance with the laws governing such proeeedings in force in such Covenanting State immediately before August 20, 1948.
In one of the Covenanting States, viz., Kapurthala, there was a law of income tax in force on the said date, the rate of tax payable under which was lower than that payable under the Patiala Income tax Act, and in another Covenanting State, Nabha, there was no law of income tax at all.
For the ac counting year ending April 12, 1948, assessees of Kapurthala State were assessed at the lower rates fixed by the Kapur thala Income tax Act, in accordance with the proviso in section 3 of the Ordinance relating to pending proceedings, and the assessees of Nabha were assessed at the higher rates fixed by the Patiala Act as there was no income tax law in Nabha on August 20, 1948, and no income tax proceedings were therefore pending in Nabha.
The petitioner who was an asses see residing in Nabha and who was assessed under the Patiala Act applied under article 32 of the Constitution for a writ in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the assessment on the ground (i) that he had been denied the fundamental right of equality before the law and equal protection of the laws guaranteed by article 14 of the Constitution inasmuch as he was assessed at a higher rate than that at which asses sees of Kapurthala were assessed, (ii) that, as the Ordi nance bringing the Patiala Income tax Act into force in Nabha was enacted only on August 20, 1948, it cannot operate retrospectively and authorise the levy of tax on income which had accrued in the year ending April 12, 1948, and therefore he was threatened with infringement of the funda mental right guaranteed by article 31 (1) of the Constitution that no one shall be deprived of his property save under authority of law: Held, (i) that the discrimination, if any, between the assessees of Kapurthala and Nabha was not brought about by the Ordinance but by the circumstance that there was no income tax law in Nabha and consequently there was no case of assessment pending against any Nabha assessees; and in any case the provision that pending proceedings should be concluded according to the applicable at the time when the right is or liabilities accrued and the proceedings com menced, was a reasonable law rounded upon reasonable classi fication of the assessees which is permissible under the equal protection clause; (ii) that, as there is a special provision in article 965 of the Constitution that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law, cl.
(1) of article 31 must be regarded as concerned with deprivation of property otherwise than by the imposition or collection of tax, and inasmuch as the right conferred by article 265 not a right conferred by Part III of the Constitution, it could not be enforced under article 129
