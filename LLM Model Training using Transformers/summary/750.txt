The appellant was tried on a charge of murder by the Sessions judge with the aid of a jury.
The evidence against him consisted of the testimony of an approver and the proof of corroborative circumstances tending to connect him with the crime.
The jury found the appellant guilty and the Sessions judge accepting the verdict sentenced him to imprisonment for life.
An appeal to the High Court was dismissed as that Court found no misdirections in the charge to the jury.
The appellant contended that there was misdirection in the charge to the jury in that the jury was not told, as laid down in Sarwan Singh vs The State of Punjab, ; , that the approver 's evidence had to satisfy a double test i.e., he must be a reliable witness and his evidence must receive sufficient corroboration and in that the corroborating evidence was not sufficient to connect the appellant with the crime.
Held, that there were no misdirections in the charge.
The observations in Sarwan Singh 's case that it must be shown that the approver was a reliable witness were made in the special circumstances of that case where the approver had definitely been found to be so thoroughly discrepant as to be wholly unreliable.
In the present case there was nothing to show that the evidence of the approver was in any way unreliable.
Saywan Singh vs The State of Punjab, ; , dis tinguished.
The Sessions judge had correctly directed the jury that the corroboration of the evidence of the approver in material particulars must relate not only to the commission of the crime, but also to the evidence connecting or tending to connect the accused with the crime.
The circumstances proved in the case corroborated the approver 's evidence connecting the appellant with the crime.
Once there was evidence of such circumstances it was for the jury to decide whether they were sufficient corroboration of the approver 's evidence that the appellant murdered the deceased.
