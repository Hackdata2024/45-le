The respondent challenged the validity of a Government Notification, and also the Minister 's order upholding the same.
At the hearing, the High Court directed that the concerned Minister be impleaded as a party, and file his personal affidavit.
Challenging the directions, the appel lant contended before this Court, that the allegations against the Minister did not disclose any personal ammus on his part, and he was not liable to be added as a party or to file his affidavit.
Partly allowing the appeal, the Court, HELD: The direction for the impleading of the Minister as a party was given by the High Court with a view to ap praise the Minister of the allegations made in the petition and thus to afford him an opportunity of controverting those .allegations, if .he so deemed proper.
We decline to interfere.
It is essentially for the Minister concerned to decide in the light of the allegations made in the petition as to whether he should or should not file an affidavit.
