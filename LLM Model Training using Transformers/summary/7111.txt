The Tribunal allowed the applications and set aside the promotions of respondents No. 2 to 13 before it.
Aggrieved by the order of the Tribunal the Union of India had preferred the present appeals.
Agreeing with the reasonings and conclusions of the Tribunal HELD:The note in Column 11 is only for purposes of giving eligibility to the erstwhile Assistants working as Superintendents Grade 11 for purposes of being considered for promotion to the post of Superintendent Grade I and not for the purpose of seniority at all.
The note merely allows the erstwhile Assistants, who were promoted to the post of Superintendent Grade 11 to include their service rendered as Assistants after 1.1.
1973 to 31.7.
1981 for purposes of counting the period of five years service as Superintendent Grade 11.
This note is for no purpose other than for giving them eligibility for consideration for promotion from the cadre of superintendent Grade 11 to the cadre of Superintendent Grade 1.
