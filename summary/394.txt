The petitioners native of Quilon within the Travancore State had been assessed to income tax for the years 1942 and 1943, the final orders in his assessment having been passed by the Chief Revenue authority of Travancore in December 1946 and November 1946 respectively.
Travancore Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1124 (Act XIV of 1124) modelled on the Indian Act XXX of 1947 was passed by the Travancore Legislature, to provide for an investigation into matters relating to taxation on income.
In July 1949 , the United State of Travancore and Cochin was brought into existence as a result of integration between the two States.
All existing laws of Travancore were to continue in force by virtue of Ordinance I of 1124 which was later enacted as Act VI of 1125.
In November 1949 the Government of the 'United State of Travancore 1197 Cochin issued orders under section 5(1) of the Travancore Act XIV of 1 124 referring the cases of the petitioner for the years 1942 and 1943 (called Evasion Cases Nos. 1 & 2 of 1125) for investigation by the Travancore Income Tax Investigation Commission.
Before the Commission could make its report the Constitution of India came into force and the United State of Travancore Cochin became a part of India (Part B State) and the Travancore Act XIV of 1124 was continued in force until altered, amended or repealed by a competent authority.
In April 1950 Parliament passed Act XXXIII of 1950 whereby Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, (Act XXX of 1947) was extended to Travancore Cochin and the law of Travancore corresponding to Act XXX of 1947 was to continue in force with certain modifications.
In October 1951, a notification issued by the Indian Investigation Commission appointed Respondent No. 1 as an authorised official under section 6 of Travancore Act XIV of 1124 read with Act XXXIII of 1950.
Respondent No. I sent a copy of that notification to the petitioner on 21st November, 1951 for his information and further intimated to him that the investigation proposed to be conducted will not be confined to the years 1942 and 1943 but that it would be necessary for him to investigate the petitioner 's income for the period from 1940 to the last completed assessment year.
The petitioner filed a writ petition in the Travancore High Court against Respondent No. I and Respondent No. 2 (Indian Income Tax Investigation Commission) for a writ of prohibition or any other writ prohibiting the Respondents from holding an enquiry into the cases registered as Evasion Cases Nos. 1 & 2 of 1126 or from holding an investigation into the income of the petitioner from the year 1940 to the last completed assessment year.
The Travancore High Court held that the Respondent No. 2 had all the powers that the Travancore Commission had under Travancore Act XIV of 1124 and no more and granted the writ prohibiting respondents from conducting an enquiry into years other than 1942 and 1943.
Both the parties appealed to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
A preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain the writ petition was repeated in the Supreme Court by the Attorney General.
Held, that the High Court bad jurisdiction under article 226 of the Constitution to issue a writ against Respondent No. 1 because under the provisions of section 6 of the Travancore Act XIV of 1124 the authorised official (Respondent No. 1) had considerable powers conferred upon him in the conduct of the investigation, and if he did anything as authorised official which was not authorised by law or was violative of the fundamental rights of the petitioner as in the present case be would be amenable to the jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution.
Held, further that under the provisions of the Travancore Act XIV of 1124 the Commission had no authority 'to investigate any case suo motu.
It could only investigate cases referred to it by 1198 Government.
All that was done in the present case was that by two separate orders made under section 5(1) of the Act the Government referred two cases of the petitioner for the two years 1942 and 1943 to the Commission.
There was no other order under section 5(1) at any time before 16th February 1950 and none could be made under that sub section after that date.
Therefore neither Respondent No. 2 nor Respondent No. 1 who had been appointed as authorised Official by Respondent No. 2 had jurisdiction to cover any period beyond the two specific years 1942 and 1943 and the notice dated 21st November 1951 issued by Respondent No. 1 to investigate the petitioner 's income for the period from 1940 to the last completed assessment year was clearly illegal and without jurisdiction.
Held, also that section 5(1) of the Travancore Act XIV of 1124 which is to be read in juxta position with section 47 of the Travancore Inc6me Tax Act, 1121 (XXIII of 1121) is not discriminatory and violative of the fundamental right guaranteed under article 14 of the Constitution.
Section 47(1) of the Travancore Act XXIII of 1121 was directed only against those persons concerning whom definite information came into the possession of the, Income tax Officer and in consequence of which the Income tax Officer discovered that the income of those persons had escaped or been under assessed or assessed at too low a rate or had been the subject of excessive relief.
The class of persons envisaged by section 47(1) was a definite class about which there was definite information leading to discovery within 8 years or 4 years as the case may be of definite item or items of income which had escaped assessment.
The action to be taken under Travancore Act XXIII of 1121 was not confined to escapement from assessment of income made during the war period (September 1939 to 1946).
Action could be taken in respect of income which escaped assessment even before the war and also more than 8 years after the end of the war.
On the other hand under section 5(1) of the Travancore Act XIV of 1124 the class of persons sought to be reached comprised only these persons about whom there was no definite information and no discovery of any definite item or items of income which escaped taxation but about whom the Government had only prima facie reason to believe that they had evaded payment of tax to a substantial amount.
Further, action under section 5(1) read with section 8(2) of the Travancore Act XIV of 1124 was definitely limited to the evasion of payment of taxation on income made during the war period and therefore section 5(1) of the Travancore Act XIV of 1124 was not discriminatory in comparison with section 47(1) of the Travancore Act XXIII of 1121.
