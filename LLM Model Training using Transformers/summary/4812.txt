With the introduction of the system known as "10 plus 2 plus 3" in the educational institutions in the country, the Association of the Indian Universities decided the equivalence of this 10+2+3 system with the old 11+3 years degree course system still prevalent is some.
States and it suggested that in all States where the pattern of education is such as to require 14 years for the first degree i.e. 11+3 years the new plus 2 stage of the Central Board of Secondary Education be treated as equivalent to a pass in the first year of the three years degree course or for admission to the first year of the two years degree Course.
The appellant Punjab University, decided on 10.2.1971 that the 12th standard examination conducted by the Boards/Universities under the new 10+2+3 system be recognised as equivalent to the Pre Medical/Pre Engineering/B.A. Part I/B.Sc.
Part I/B. Com.
Part I examination according to the combination of the subjects.
Subsequently, on 4.6.1978 the Punjab University decided to treat the 11th standard of the new 10+2+3 system as equivalent to the Pre University examination of the University.
These recognitions of the equivalence of these two examinations continued till the beginning of the year 1980.
But on 18.4.1980 the Punjab University decided that the first year student of the plus 2 course in the 10+2+3 system of the Central Board 's schools who does not take a public examination at the end of the first year.
should not be considered as equivalent to the student who has passed the pre University examination of the Punjab University for joining the Pre Medical/Pre Engineering/B.A. Part I/B. Sc.
Part II B. Com.
Part I of the University.
On 7.5.1980, the Punjab University decided that the 12th Standard Examination in the new 10+2+3 system conducted by any recognised Board/Council/University shall be treated as equivalent to the pre University Examination of the University.
The respondents in CA 1977/80, namely 1 to 37 who had passed the 12th Standard Examination in the 10+2+3 system of the Central Board of Education and respondents 38 to 92 who had been promoted from the 11th Standard to the 12th Standard in that system challenged the two decisions 816 of the Punjab University dated 18.4.1980, and 7.5.1980 by filing W.P. 1917 of 1980 contending that in view of the earlier decisions of the University namely, Annexures P. 2 and P. 3 dated 10.12.1977 and 4.6.1978 respectively they had joined the classes in the plus 2 course with the object of joining the colleges affiliated to the University in the next class of equivalence as also Engineering and Medical Colleges and that the University cannot, therefore, change those decisions by the subsequent decisions, (Annexures R. 2 and R. 3) to their detriment.
They invoked the doctrine of promissory estoppel in regard to that ground of attack on those two decisions.
The second ground of attack by the petitioners in W.P. 1917 of 1980 was that the decisions Annexures R. 2 & R. 3 are retrospective in operation and they have taken away their vested right and that the University has no power, either under the Punjab University Act or under any statute, regulation or rule to make any regulation rule or ordinance adversely affecting their vested rights retrospectively.
The learned Judges of the Division Bench rejected the contention of the petitioners before them that the Syndicate has no power which the Senate has under section 31 of the Act and held that the Syndicate has similar powers under section 20 (5) of the Act.
They rejected the further contention that there is any bar of promissory estoppel against the University in regard to the matter and, however, held that petitioners 1 to 37 had joined tho 10+2 course in the Central School lying within the territorial jurisdiction of the Punjab University in 1978 and had passed the 12th Standard Examination and had planned their education in a particular manner to join the colleges affiliated to the Punjab University in the second year of the 3 year degree course and other courses after passing the 12th standard examination in the plus 2 system.
They held that Annexure R. 3 will deprive petitioners I to 31 and Annexure R. 2 will deprive petitioners 38 to 92 of right to seek admission in Engineering and Medical Colleges after passing the 12th Standard in the 10+2 system.
and Annexures R. 2 and R. 3 take away that right and are retrospective in nature.
In coming to this conclusion the learned Judges of the Division Bench relied very strongly upon the decision of the Full Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in Punjab University vs Subhash Chander, In view of their decision in W.P. 1911 of 1980, another Bench allowed another W P. 2349 of 1980 filed by the respondents in C.A. 2667/83.
Hence the appeals by the University.
Allowing the appeal, the Court.
^ HELD: 1.
The decisions dated 10.12.1977, 4.6.1978, 18.4.1980 and 7.5.1980 respectively are intra vires the powers of the Syndicate to make rules etc.
under section 20(5) of the Punjab University Act in the same manner as the Senate can do under section 31 of that Act.
[819F] 2.
In view of the decision of the Supreme Court dated 17.5 1984 rendered in Subhash Chander vs Punjab University (Civil Appeal No. 2828/ 1977 arising out of and reversing the said decision of the Punjab High Court relying on which the two Judgments now under 817 appeal, were passed, in the present case also the two impugned decisions are prima facie prospective in operation and they did not become retrospective merely because they subsequently applied to students who had already started their educational careers.
However, this decision will not effect the right which might have been granted to the petitioners in the writ petitions on the basis of the Judgments of the High Court which have been reversed in these appeals [820F; 821E F]
