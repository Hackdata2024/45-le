Under the Madhya Bharat Municipalities Act, 1954, the Municipal Corporation determined the house lax payable by the appellant in respect of his house with effect from April 1, 1954.
On appeal by the appellant regarding assessment, the Additional District Judge remanded the case to the Corporation for a fresh decision after due enquiry.
Ulti mately, by a notice dated October 12, 1965 issued under section 146 of the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 (as amended in 1961) the Corporation revised the amount of tax payable but maintained the date of liability for payment of tax as April 1, 1954.
On appeal by the appellant, the additional District Judge held that the tax was payable with effect from April 1, 1965 and not April 1, 1954 for the reason that the tax was finally fixed after the notice dated October 12, 1965.
The Revision Petition of the Corporation was allowed by the High Court holding that tax was payable from April 1, 1954 because the proceedings were started even before the 1956 Act came into force.
In appeal to this Court the appellant contended that (1 ) as the fresh notice was issued under section 146 of the 1956 Act on October 12, 1965 after remand of the case by the District Judge, house lax could be imposed only with effect from April 1, 1965 and not retrospectively and (2) the order of the District Judge being final under section 149(2) of the 1956 Act the High Court had no jurisdiction to interfere with that order and in any event the High Court exceeded its power under section 115, C.P.C. Dismissing the appeal.
HELD: The proceeding relating to the house tax was a continuous proceeding relating to the tax payable from April 1, 1954 and the notice issued by the Corporation after remand by the District Judge did not amount to notice of fresh assessment or re assessment.
[874 E F] 1.
There is no force in the contention .that under the 1956 Act the municipality had no power to pursue the pro ceedings regarding the levy of tax for an earlier period.
The notice issued by the Corporation to the appellant made it clear that the Commissioner was proceeding to fix the value in pursuance of the remand.
The appellant 's plea that the Commissioner was not authorised to determine the value and impose the tax for any period before the date of issue of the notice ignores the fact that the valuation and deter mination of tax from 1954 was pending and the proceedings related to that period.
Section 3(3) of the 1956 Act pro vides that all rates, taxes and sums of money due to the Municipalities when this Act was made applicable shall be deemed to be due to the Corporation and sub section
(4.) states that all suits and other legal proceedings instituted by or against a Municipality may be continued by or against the Corporation.
The proceedings in the instant case were originally taken under the Madhya Bharat Municipalities Act, 1954 and the proceedings regarding the levy of the house tax were not concluded when under the new Act the Corporation became entitled to pursue the proceedings.
