The appellant had been incorporated in 1944 as a private company limited by shares in the former State of Bhor with its registered office in Bhor.
The shareholders of the company were at all material times resident in British India.
By virtue of the States Merger (Governors ' Provinces) Order, 1949, the State was merged with the Province of Bombay with effect from August 1, 1949.
The provisions of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, were extended to the merged State with effect from April 1, 1949.
Under the power given by section 60A of the Act which enabled the Central Government to remove any difficulty in the application of the Act to merged States by making a general or special order granting exemption or other modification, the Central Government notified the Merged States (Taxation Concessions) Order, 1949.
Paragraph 12 of that Order stated that " the provisions of section 23A of tile Indian Income tax Act shall not be applied in respect of the profits and gains of any previous year ending before 1st day of August, 1949, unless the State law contains a provision corresponding thereto.
" The total world income of the company for 1946 and 1947 was Rs. 6,57,084 and 7,8o, 125 respectively and for those years the company declared dividends of Rs. 2,580 and Rs. 1140.
For the assessment years 1947 48 and 52 410 1948 49, corresponding to the account years 1946 and 1947, the Income tax Officers assessed the company as nonresident ; for the assessment year 1947 48, the Officer held that ' the assessable income of the company in British India for 1946 less the taxes must be deemed to be distributed among the shareholders in the proportion of their shareholdings, under section 23A of the Act, while for the account year 1947, the total world income less the taxes was deemed to be is tributed, the part proportionate to the income in Bhor State being excluded, except for purposes of rate.
In computing the " deemed dividends " the Income tax Officer did not deduct the interest charged to the company under section 18A (8) from the assessable income along with the income tax and super tax under section 23A(1).
The company and the shareholders claimed (1) that para.
12 of the Merged States (Taxation Concessions) Order, 1949, precluded the Income tax Officer from making an order under section 23A of the Act in respect of the profits and gains of the account years ending December 31, 1946, and December 31, 1947, which were previous years ending before August 1, 1949, and (2) that, in any case, interest under section 18A(8) ought to have been deducted along with the income tax before the fictional dividends were computed.
A further contention was raised that since the dividends in question would be deemed to have been declared in Bhor State and received there, unless another fiction was engrafted upon the fiction created in section 23A that the dividends must be deemed to have been received in the taxable territories, they could not be taxed in the hands of the shareholders.
The shareholders also claimed the benefit of s 14(2)(C) in respect of the entire amount of the balance deemed to be distributed.
Held: (1) that the expression "any previous year" in para.
12 of the Merged States (Taxation Concessions) Order, 1949, did not refer to all the previous years prior to and ending before August 1, 1949, but meant only one previous year, which would be a previous year for the purposes of the assessment year 194950, but which, to get the exemption, must end before the first day of August, 1949; (2) that the force of the fiction under section 23A of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, which makes the dividends which ought to have been distributed to be so distributed, transcends all questions of accrual and receipt, and what is deemed to be distributed must also be deemed to have accrued and received by the person to whom it is deemed to be distributed; (3) that section 14(2)(c) of the Act saves only that portion of the income which is not assessable in the taxable territories by reason of its accrual in the State and does not affect the operation of section 23A on the assessable income of the company which, by reason of the application of the Indian Income tax Act even prior to the extension of the Act to the State after merger, was assessable under the Act 411 (4) that the wording of section 18A(8) of the Act under which interest is recoverable along with the tax, does not show that it is to be treated as tax but retains its character as interest, and since section 23A speaks of deduction only of income tax and supertax, no deduction could be made in respect of the interest under that section.
