The appellant was a contractual tenant of certain premises in the town of Calcutta of which the respondents were the owners.
The respondents called upon the appellant to vacate and deliver possession of the premises on the expiration of the period of tenancy but possession was not delivered and the respondents were unable to obtain possession in view of the protection afforded to the tenants by the successive rent control Acts passed by the State.
In the meantime the 814 appellant continued to pay every month amounts equal to the contractual rent, and later the rent declared to be the statutory rent and the respondent accepted the same.
The question arising for decision was whether the acceptance of the amounts by the respondents conferred upon the appellant the right of a tenant holding over within the meaning of section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act.
Held, that where a contractual tenancy to which the rent control legislation applied, had expired by efflux of time or by determination by notice to quit and the tenant continued in possession of the premises, acceptance of rent from the tenant by the landlord after the expiration or determination of the contractual tenancy will not afford ground for holding that the landlord had assented to a new contractual tenancy.

Acceptance by the landlord from the tenant of amounts equivalent to rent after the contractual tenancy had expired or amounts which were fixed as standard rent did not amount to acceptance of rent from a lessee within the meaning of section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act.
Occupation of the appellant after the determination of tenancy was not in pursuance of any contract express or implied but was by virtue of protection granted by the successive statutes and such occupation was not required to be determined in the manner prescribed by section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act.
