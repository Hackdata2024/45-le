One Nanalal Karsandas, who was a brick manufacturer, held a priority certificate for purchasing coal under the Colliery Control Order and purchased a certain quantity of coal from M/s. section G. Rungta Colliery through the respondents who were commission agents.
The respondents applied to the Collector for determining whether they could be described as "dealers" under the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1953.
The Collector held that they were dealers but the Sales Tax Tribunal held otherwise.
No step was taken thereafter for a reference to the High 368 Court under sections 34(1) and 30(1) of the Act.
On appeal by the State of Bombay by special leave, Held, that the respondents could not be described as "dealers" under the Act as the nature of their business as disclosed by them did not show that they were carrying on the business of selling goods in the State of Bombay but were only commission agents arranging sales to other persons.
The proper course for the appellant was to move the High Court and exhaust all his remedies before invoking the jurisdiction of this court under article 136 of the Constitution.
