The question involved in these appeals was whether the amounts collected for spending on charity and kept in a separate account for Dharmadha could be included in the business income of the assessee.
The explanation that these amounts were distributed among the poor relatives of the labourers and to the girls in their families at the time of marriage, was not accepted by the Income tax Officer as a charity.
He added the entire dharmadha amounts to the business income of the appellant assessees.
On appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner deleted the said additions, and the Tribunal confirmed the deletions.
Revenue filed ap plications before the High Court for reference.
The High Court having dismissed the applications, Revenue preferred the present appeals contending that the assessees were using the amounts collected in the name of dharmadha for business purposes.
Allowing the appeals, this Court, HELD:1.
So far as the inclusion of amounts collected as Dharmada which are kept in a separate account and are utilised for charitable purposes is concerned, there can be no dispute that they are not liable to be included in the income of the assessee.
The Revenue 's case is that though collected in the name of Dharmada, these amounts were neither meant for any charitable purpose nor were they spent on charitable purposes.
In these circumstances, the High Court ought to have directed the Tribunal to state the question under Sec.256(2) of the Income tax Act, 875 1961, as to whether such amounts could be assessed to tax as revenue receipts.
The Tribunal is directed to do so.
