The trust deed executed by the husband of the respondent assessee provided that the trustees should pay to the assessee during her life time 50 per cent of the income of the trust fund.
The settlement was irrevocable and the properties mentioned in the schedule to the trust deed stood transferred to the name of the trustees.
Under the clauses of the deed ,the trust fund was not a fixed sum but was capable of being augmented.
On the question whether the assessee was entitled only to an annuity within the meaning of that expression in section 2(e) (iv) of the Wealth Tax Act or had an interest in the corpus of the trust which could be brought to tax under the Wealth tax Act.
HELD: The intention of the husband was that the assessee should get 15130 share from out of the income of the trust fund.
Since neither the trust fund nor the amount payable to the assessee was a fixed sum, what the assessee was entitled to was not an annuity but an allquot share in the income of the trust fund.
The fact that in the particular assessment year there was no change in the trust fund was irrelevant because the question whether a particular income is an annuity or not does not depend upon the amount received in a particular year.
[712 D H] Hence the assessee had a life interest in the trust fund which could be brought to tax under the Wealth tax Act.
