The petitioner, a member of the Scheduled Castes, secured the 7th position in the test and interview held for filling up six vacancies in the post of stenographer and was not selected for appointment.
The State Government had, by an order, directed that 18 per cent of the posts in the subordinate services should be reserved for Scheduled Castes whenever recruitment was to be made through competition and also provided that in the roster register of every 25 vacancies, the 1st 7th, 13th, 19th and 25th vacancies should be reserved for Scheduled Castes.
The stand taken by the respondents was that while making selection to the six vacancies in question, no reservation had been intended to be made in view of the position that the post of stenographer was covered under Class III service and the total strength of Class III employees as on the relevant date was 132 and there were as many as 28 among them belonging to the Scheduled Castes which was more than 21 per cent.
The petitioner contended that the direction regarding reservation should have been applied and he should have been selected for appointment.
Allowing the petition, ^ HELD: That more than 21 per cent of the posts in Grade III service were being manned by people belonging to Scheduled Castes at the relevant time is no answer to the prescription of the roster.
It is not known whether some of the recruits of earlier years already in service belonging to the Scheduled Castes had come on the basis of overall merit without reference to reservation.
When six vacancies were being filled up at a time in one year if the roster was to be followed, one of the posts would indisputably have gone to the candidate of the Scheduled Castes.
As per the roster, the petitioner was entitled to be appointed against the first vacancy.
