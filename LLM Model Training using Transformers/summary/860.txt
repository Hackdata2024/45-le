The Appellant Bank which was registered under the Co operative Societies 'Act, 1922, received, in the relevant account years, by way of interest on deposits with the Imperial Bank of India certain sums of money.
The Income tax Officer assessed the aforesaid sums under section 12 of the Indian Income tax Act 1922, as income from other sources, but the appellant claimed that the deposits were made not with the idea of making investments but for the purpose of carrying on its business as a bank and that as the interest received on the deposits was profit attributable to its business activities it was not subject to incometax because of the Notification issued by the Central Government under section 6o of the Act.
Under the Notification profits of any Co operative Society are exempt from the tax payable under the Act but not income derived from "other sources" referred to in section 12 of the Act.
Held, that the interest from deposits received by the Appel lant Bank in the present case arose out of a transaction entered into for the purpose of carrying on its banking business and fell within the income exempted under the Notification.
