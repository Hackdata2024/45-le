Section 13A of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949 lays down the procedure for a 'specified landlord ' to seek immediate recovery of possession of his residential building at any time within one year prior to or within one year after the date of his retirement or after his retire ment but within one year of the date of commencement of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction (Amendment) Act, 1985, whichever is later.
Section 2(hh) of the Act defines 'speci fied landlord ' to mean a person who is entitled to receive rent in respect of a building on his own account and who is holding or has held an appointment in a public service or post in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State.
The appellant, who was holding a post in connection with the affairs of the State, had retired on September 30, 1981.
He was member of a Mitakshara family.
The house in question was tenanted out to the respondent by his father in July 1982 and upon his father dying in the following month the tenant attorned to the appellant.
The amendment came into force with effect from November 16, 1985.
The appellant applied for eviction on May 13, 1986.
He sought benefit of the special procedure laid down in section 13A of the Act on the ground that all the ingredients of the definition of 'speci fied landlord ' were satisfied.
The courts below rejected the contention.
The High Court relying on the ratio laid down by this Court in D.N. Malhotra vs Kartar Singh, [1988] 1 SCC 656 and Mrs. Winifred Ross vs Mrs. Ivy Fonseca, [1984] 1 SCC 288 held that the appellant could not be a 'specified land lord '.
Dismissing the appeal by special leave, HELD: Until the landlord satisfies the test that he was a landlord qua the premises and the tenant at the time of his retirement or dis 94 charge from service.
he can not be a 'specified landlord ' as defined in section 2(hh) of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restric tion Act, 1949.
[98F, 94F] In the instant case, the appellant was not the landlord of the premises in question before he superannuated.
He would not, therefore, be entitled to the benefit of the special procedure laid down in section 13A of the Act.
[99A B] D.N. Malhotra vs Kartar Singh, [1988] 1 SCC 656 and Mrs. Winifred Ross vs Mrs. Ivy Fonseca, [1984] 1 SCC 288, ap plied.
