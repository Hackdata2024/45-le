The appellant Corporation assessed property tax in respect of buildings belonging to the respondent Market Committee, which refused to pay the same.
Proceedings were commenced for recovery of the dues.
The respondent moved the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution for quash ing the recovery proceedings.
The High Court following its earlier decision arising under Section 334 of the M.P. Municipalities Act, 1961 allowed the petition, quashed the recovery proceedings and directed the Corporation to refer the dispute to the Govern ment under Section 415 of the M.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1956.
Aggrieved by the aforesaid decision, the Corporation, appealed to this court.
Allowing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1.
The assessment of tax or demand of any fees by the Corporation under the provisions of the M.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 could fail within the term "anything done or intended to be done under the Act" as provided under Section 415 of the Act.
Even 145 refusal of the Corporation to consider the objections against assessment and recovery of tax or fees could also be considered as "anything done or intended to be done under the Act".
But section 415 does not provide that the Corpora tion has to move the Government when the local authority has refused to pay the tax or fees levied and demanded.
[148GH; 149A] 2.
The structure of section 415 of the M.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 is different from section 334 of the M.P. MuniCipalities Act; 1961.
Section 415 speaks of dispute between the Corporation and local authority as regards anything done or to be done under the Act.
And such a dis pute shall be referred to the Government for decision.
Section 334 refers to a dispute on a matter in which the Municipal Council and local authority are jointly interested and it states that such dispute shall be referred to the State Government for decision.
Section 334 does not refer to the dispute as regards "anything done or to be done under the Act.
" Section 415 does not speak of any dispute in which the Corporation and the local authority are jointly inter ested.
There are no rules framed for operation of section 415 while under section 334 the State Government has framed Rules.
In view of these differences the view taken by the High Court that the Corporation must take steps to resolve the dispute cannot be justified.
It has apparently no sup port either from the terms of section 415, or from any rules framed for the purpose.
Therefore, the recovery proceedings should not have been quashed by the High Court.
And the Corporation should not have been directed to refer the dispute to the Government under section 415 of the M.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1956.
