The appellant company served a charge sheet on the res pondent who was one of its employees alleging that he had stolen the cycle of the company 's Head Clerk.
A criminal case relating 228 to the theft was pending against him then.
He was asked to show cause why he should not be dismissed for misconduct, and as his explanation was unsatisfactory a certain date was fixed for enquiry.
The respondent appeared before the enquiry committee but refused to participate in the enquiry by answering questions put to him as he did not want to produce any defence till the matter was decided by the Court.
The company,however,after completing the enquiry directed the dismissal of the respondent on the ground that misconduct had been proved against him.
The company thereafter made an application under section 33(2) Of the Industrial Disputes Act to the Industrial Tribunal for approval of the disciplinary action taken against the respondent.
In the meantime the respondent was acquitted by the Criminal Court. 'The judgment of the Criminal Court was produced before the tribunal which refused to approve the order of dismissal of the respondent.
On appeal by the company by special leave : Held, that the principles of natural justice do not require that an employer must wait for the decision of the Criminal Trial Court before taking disciplinary action against an employee.
Shri Bimal Kanta Mukherjee vs Messrs. Newsman 's Printing Works, , approved.
If a case is of a grave nature involving questions of fact and law which are not simple it would be advisable for the employer to await the decision of the Criminal Trial Court but in a simple case like the present the tribunal erred in not granting approval under section 33(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act.
