This appeal was against the order of the Deputy Registrar directing the present case to be registered as nine appeals and requiring the appellant to pay nine sets of court fees.
The case originated out of one petition under article 226 of the Constition challenging the validity of various assessment orders.
The High Court passed one order on the petition and one appeal was filed in this Court.
886 Held that the appellant should pay only one set of court fee and other charges as in a single appeal.
It could not be said that there were as many proceedings as there were assessment orders as the appellant had by a single petition challenged them all together.
