The appellants claimed title to the lands in dispute on the basis of section 4(1) of the Bengal Alluvion and Deluvion Regulation XI of 1825.
To establish their claim based upon the clause, the appellants had to prove that the lands were gained by gradual accession from the recess of the river and that the lands were accretions to plots in the possession of the appellants or their ancestors.
Since the survey records from 1892 to 1909 showed that appellants ' ancestors held some of the frontier plots, the High Court was asked to draw the inference that they held those plots during 1845 to 1863 when the lands in dispute accrcted.
The High Court refused to draw the inference.
In appeal to this Court, HELD : If a thing or a state of things is shown to exist, an inference of its continuity within a reasonably proximate time both forwards and, in appropriate cases, backwards, may be drawn under section 114, Evidence Act.
But it was not safe to assume in the present case that a state of things during 1892 to 1909 existed during 1845 to 1863 since the interval of time was too Inng.
