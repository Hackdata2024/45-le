A who was a tenant of N sub let the premises to B and C. N filed a suit for ejectment against A, B and C in the Court of Small Causes, Bombay, on the ground of illegal sub letting.
The suit was decreed.
Thereafter, A, B and C filed the present suit in the Bombay City Civil Court for a declaration that A was a tenant of N and was protected from eviction by the provisions of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947, and that B and C were lawful sub tenants of A and were as such entitled to possession, use and occupation of the premises.
The City Civil Court held that it had jurisdiction to entertain the suit but dismissed it on the ground that there was no lawful subletting.
On appeal, the Bombay High Court held that the City Civil Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit and dismissed the appeal without going into the merits : Held, that the High Court was right in holding that section 28 of the Act barred the City Civil Court from entertaining the suit.
Section 28 explicitly confers on courts specified therein jurisdiction to entertain a suit between a landlord and a tenant in respect of a claim which arose out of the Act or any of its provisions, 368 and expressly prohibits any other court exercising jurisdiction with respect thereto.
In the present suit the claim being one which arose out of the Act, and the City Civil Court not being a court specified in section 28, it could not entertain the suit.
Though section 29A of the Act allows questions of title to be regarded in a civil court, it applies only to titles which do not arise out of the Act or any of its provisions; and titles which could riot be established outside the Act but which arose under the provisions of the Act by virtue of a claim made thereunder must be determined by a court specified in section 28.
