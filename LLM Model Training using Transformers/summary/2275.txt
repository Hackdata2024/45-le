Under section 13(1)(e) of the Delhi and Ajmer Rent Control Act, 1952, the jurisdiction of the court to evict a tenant, may be exercised in favour of a landlord who wants the premises bona fide for his own residence, only when the premises are let out for residential purposes, and not, when the premises being let out for composite purposes, are used for residential and non residential purposes.
The owner of a house let it out to the appellant for her residence and for running a school.
The respondent purchased the house and filed a suit for eviction of the appellant.
The suit was dismissed, but the High Court, in revision, held that a decree in ejectment limited to that portion of the house which was used for residential purposes by the tenant could be granted, and remanded the case for demarcating that portion and passing a decree.
In appeal to this Court, HELD:The order of the High Court was without jurisdiction and should be set aside.
[540A] The contract of tenancy was a single and indivisible contract, and, in the absence of any statutory provision to that effect, it was not open to the Court to divide it into two contracts one of letting out for residential purposes and the other for non residential purposes and to grant relief under the section in respect of that portion of the property which was being used for residential purposes.
