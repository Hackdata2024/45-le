The appellant Board cancelled the declaration of the result of the respondent in the High School Certificate Examination held in 1960 accepting the findings of the subcommittee appointed by it to enquire into the charges made against the respondent and another candidate of having used unfair means in answering the English, Mathematics and Hindi papers.
The charges were based upon the fact that in the Hindi 3rd paper set at the said examination, the respondent gave wrong answers to Question No. 4 in precisely the same form in which the answers had been given by the candidate whose Roll number was consecutive with that of the respondent.
The High Court interpreting the charge as confined to that the respondent had copied either from the answer book of the candidate bearing the consecutive Roll Number or from a common source held that the findings of the enquiry committee were based on no evidence and quashed the cancellation of the result.
On appeal by special leave.
Held, that in the circumstances of the case, the identity of the wrong answers given by the respondent with that of the other candidate bearing the consecutive Roll Number rendered the charge of the respondent having employed unfair means highly probable and that the findings of the enquiry committee based upon such probabilities and circumstantial evidence could not be said to be based on no evidence as in such matters direct evidence quite often cannot be available.
Held, further, that in dealing with cases like those of educational institutions dealing with matters of discipline like employing unfair means, the problem faced by the educational institutions should be appreciated by the 'High Court and so long as the enquiry held is fair and affords the candidate an opportunity to defend himself, the matter should 768 not be examined with the same strictness as applicable to criminal trials in the ordinary courts of law.
