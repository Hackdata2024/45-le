In respect of the assessment years 1959 60 and 1960 61, fresh assessments were made under section 12A of the Mysore General Sales Tax Act 1957 by the , Commercial Tax Offi cer.
By his order dated June 8, 1966, certain amounts which had escaped assessment under the original assessment orders dated March 21, 1963 were included in the turnover of the respondent, but the deductions in respect of shop rent and tree tax were, however, allowed as in the initial orders.
The appellant, in exercise of the powers under section 21(2) of the Act, by his orders dated June 28, 1967 revised the orders dated June 8, 1966 disallowing the deductions in respect of the shop rent, following the decision of this Court in Shinde Brother etc.
vs Deputy Commissioner Raichur Two rectification applications and the two appeals therefrom on the ground that the revisions of assessment were barred by limitation under section 21(3) of the Act and, as such, there was a mistake apparent on the record were rejected as not maintainable.
However, the writ petitions filed were allowed by the High Court holding that the orders dated June 28, 1967 were without jurisdic tion since they had been made beyond the period of four years from the date of the initial assessment orders dated March 21, 1963.
On appeals by special leave to this Court, HELD: The contention advanced on behalf of the appel lants that the period of four years mentioned in section 21(3) of the Act should be computed from the orders dated June 8, 1966 made under S 12A of the Act and not from the ini tial orders of assessment dated March 21, 1963 is well founded.
[595 C D] Once an assessment is reopened the initial order for as sessment ceases to be operative.
The effect of reopening the assessment is to vacate or set aside the initial order for assessment and to substitute in its place the order made on reassessment.
The initial order for reassessment cannot be said to survive even partially although the justification for dessessment arises because of turnover escaping assess ment in a limited field or only with respect to a part of the matter covered by the initial assessment order.
The result of reopening the assessment is that a fresh order for reassessment would have to be made including for those matters in respect of which there is no allegation of the turnover escaping assessment.
[596 D E] In the present case the assessment orders made under section 12A were comprehensive orders and were not confined merely to matters which had escaped assessment earlier and the only orders which could be the subject matter of revision by the appellant were the orders made under section 12A of the Act and not the initial assessment orders.
