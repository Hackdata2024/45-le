The Plaintiff respondent instituted a suit for recovery of Rs.1,39,722.86 against the defendants appellants.
When evidence was being recorded in the suit proceedings, the plaintiff obtained summons from the court requiring the Income Tax Department to produce in the court records relating to the income tax assessment of the defendants for the assessment years 1964 65 to 1971 72.
The Income Tax Officer produced the record in a sealed cover.
The plaintiff also obtained summons requiring the Income Tax Officer to produce the income tax record relating to two other assessees, which was produced in the Court by the Department in a sealed cover with a submission that no disclosure of information regarding income tax 546 pertaining to an income tax assessee could be made.
The plaintiffs in the meanwhile filed in the court a number of certified copies of the accounts of the defendants, which he had obtained from the Income Tax authorities and sought permission of the Court to tender the certified copies in evidence.
Before a Single Judge of the High Court on the question of privilege as claimed by the Income Tax Department, arguments were addressed by the parties.
The following three questions were referred to the Full Bench (i) What is the position of law relating to privilege prior to 1964? (ii) What is the position of law relating to privilege after 1964? and (iii) What is the effect of the production of certified copies relating to income tax assessment records, and how far certified copies can be admitted in evidence? The Full Bench answered the first and second questions sustaining the claim of the privilege by the Income Tax Department and the Full Bench did not express any opinion on the third question.
Against the judgment of the Full Bench of the High Court, appeal was filed by special leave.
The controversy before this Court was confined to the finding of the High Court relating to the claim of privilege for the production of documents which were filed after the repeal of Section 137, with effect from 1.4.1964 in respect of assessment years 1964 65 onwards.
The appellants (defendants) contended that after the repeal of Section 137 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 by the Finance Act, 1964 there was no longer any impediment left in the way of a civil court to summon the production of documents filed by an assessee during the assessment proceedings before an Income Tax Officer after 1.4.1964 in respect of assessment years 1964 65 onwards, and that the finality attached to an order of the Commissioner with regard to claim of privilege under Section 138(1)(b) had no relationship to the power of the court to summon that record.
Allowing the appeal of the defendants appellants, this Court, 547 HELD:1.01.
Section 54 of the Income Tax Act, 1922 and after its repeal, Section 137 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 had only placed fetters on the exercise of the jurisdiction, in respect of the specified documents, by the courts, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force.
The exercise of the jurisdiction to seek production of documents had, only been put under a cloud in so far as the record of assessment is concerned.
[560E] 1.02.
With the repeal of the 1922 Act and omission of Section 137 of the 1961 Act, the fetters on the exercise of the jurisdiction were removed with the result that the exercise of jurisdiction to call for the production of documents relevant to the case pending before the court, even from the income tax authorities, revived.
[560E F] 1.03.
Neither Section 54 of the 1922 Act nor Section 137 of the 1961 Act had taken away for all times the jurisdiction of the courts to call for the record from the Income Tax authorities.
Those provisions had only put the exercise of that jurisdiction under a cloud and those fetters were coterminous with the life of Section 54 of the 1922 Act or Section 137 of the 1961 Act.
[560F G] 2.01.
Clause (b) of Sub Section (1) of Section 138 is limited in its scope and application.
Under it, any person can make an application to the Commissioner for any information relating to an assessee in respect of any assessment made either under the 1922 Act or under the 1961 Act on or after the 1st April 1960 and the Commissioner of Income Tax has the authority to furnish or cause to be furnished the information asked for on being satisfied that it is in the public interest so to do and such an order of the Commissioner is final and cannot be called in question in any court of law.
The Commissioner of Income Tax under this clause performs only an administrative function, on his subjective satisfaction as to whether it is in the public interest to furnish the information or not to any person seeking such information and his decision in that behalf is final and the aggrieved person cannot question it in a court of law.
By enacting this provision, the legislature could not be said to have intended that the Commissioner of Income Tax would have the authority to sit in judgment over the requisition (Judicial order) made by a court of law requiring the production of record of assessment relating to an assessee in a case pending before the court.
[562H 563D] 548 2.02.
When a court of law, in any matter pending before it, desires the production of record relating to any assessment after applying its judicial mind and hearing the parties and on being prima facie satisfied that the record required to be summoned is relevant for the decision of the controversy before it it passes a judicial order summoning the production of that record from the Party having possession of the record.
The Commissioner of Income Tax cannot, therefore, refuse to send the record, as he certainly is not authorised to set at naught a judicial order of a court law.
He must obey the order of the court by sending the record to the court concerned.
[563D F] 2.03.
It is open to the Commissioner of Income Tax to claim privilege, in respect of any document or record so summoned by a court of law, under Sections 123 and 124 of the and even then it is for the court to decide whether or not to grant that privilege.
Had the legislature intended that no document from the assessment record of an assessee should be produced in a court on being summoned by it, without the approval of the Commissioner of Income Tax, it would have said so in Section 138 of the Act itself.
[563F G] 2.04.
The repeal of Section 137 of the Act clearly discloses the legislative intent that it was felt by the legislature that it was no more necessary to keep the records of assessment by the Income Tax Department relating to an assessee as confidential from the courts and the bar with regard to the production of any part of the record was removed in so far as the courts are concerned.
The finality which has been attached to the order of the Commissioner under Section 138(1)(b) of the Act is restricted to the cases where the information etc.
as contemplated by the section is called for by any person, other than a court of law by a judicial order.
[563G 564A] 2.05 The finality which has been attached to the order of the Commissioner under Section 138(1)(b) of the Act is applicable only in cases where application is made to the Commissioner by a party or any other person for receiving documents or information.
It has nothing to do with the powers of the courts to summon the production of assessment record of an assessee, filed after 1.4.1964.
The privilege as to secrecy, which the assessee had acquired under Section 54 of the 1922 Act remained unimpaired by the repeal of that Act or even by the omission of Section 549 137 of the 1961 Act in respect of record filed prior to 1.4.1964 and relating to the assessments prior to that date.
That privilege did not extend, after April 1,1964.
to record filed before the income tax authorities, for the assessment years 1964 65 onwards.
[560H 561B] 2.06.
Section 138(1)(b) does not effect the powers of the courts to require the production of assessment records or the disclosure of any information therefrom to it, in a case pending before the court when the court, by a judicial order, requires the production of the record, considered relevant by it for decision of a case pending before it.
[564B C] 2.07.
The High Court, therefore, fell in error in holding that the assessment records of an assessee filed before the income tax authorities, even after April 1,1964, are immune from production in a court of law on summons for their production being issued by the court and that the disclosure of any information from the record even to the courts is subject to the veto powers of the Commissioner of Income Tax.
[564B] 3.01.
Section 6 of the General Clauses Act as well as Section 138 (1)(b) of the 1961 Act cannot extend the ban on the exercise of the jurisdiction by the courts to summon the production of documents from the income tax authorities after April 1,1964 relating to assessment year 1964 65 in respect of the record filed after April 1,1964.
[561B C] 3.02.
Section 6 of the General Clauses Act provides that the repeal of any enactment, unless a different intention appears, shall not affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the repealed enactment.
[561F] 3.03 The general principle is that an enactment which is repealed, is to be treated, except as to transactions past and closed, as if it had never existed.
The assessee had acquired no right or privilege under the repealed Act, since the provision is only a procedural restriction and did not create any substantive right in the assessee, in respect of assessments for the period after the omission of Section 137 of the 1961 Act.
Thus, reliance placed on the provisions of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act to hold the continuation of the ban on the exercise of jurisdiction by the courts was misplaced.
[561H 562B] 3.04.
In respect of the documents filed after the omission of Section 550 137 of the 1961 Act , with effect from April 1,1964, relating to assessments for the period 1964 65 onwards, no right, privilege, obligation or liability can be said to have been acquired accrued or incurred prior to the omission of Section 137 of the Act.
[561F G] 3.05 The ban contained in Section 137 of the 1961 Act on the exercise of the powers of a civil court to call for production of documents etc.
could not be said to have continued to exist, in matters arising subsequent to the omission of that Section with effect from April 1, 1964 and that ban came to an end in respect of the period after April 1, 1964.
[561G] 4.
After the repeal of Section 137 of the act, there is no longer any impediment left in the way of a court to summon the production of documents filed by an assessee before the income tax authorities after April 1,1964 relating to assessment proceedings for 1964 65 onwards and that the finality attached to an order of the Commissioner under Section 138 (1)(b) has no relevance to the exercise of powers by a court to summon the production of documents in a case pending before the Court.
