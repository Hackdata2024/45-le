A scheme for the distribution of cloth was evolved by the Deputy Commissioner of the District who appointed a group of persons as sole agents for the import of cloth from Mills and distribution of the same to retailers.
Though for different periods the group was differently constituted, one of the members, firm 'H ' remained a common member.
The profits of the business were distributed amongst the members of the group in proportion of the capital contributed by them.
The Income tax Officer issued notice under section 22(4) Of the Indian Income tax Act, and on production of books of account assessed the respondent as an "Association of Persons".
The High Court was of the opinion, inter alia that before a group of persons could be called an "Association of Persons" it had to be established that they were in the "nature of partners", which was not so in the instant case, as the members of the group were appointed by the Deputy Commissioner as importers; the participation of the group could not be held to be of free will but under compulsion and therefore they were not an "Association of Persons" within the meaning Of section 3 Of the Indian Income tax Act.
Held, that where a business is carried on and the profits ascertained on a joint basis, and then distributed according to the capital contributed by each.
member of the group, the group is an "Association of Persons" and it makes no difference that the scheme which produced profits was at the instance of or under the control of the Deputy Commissioner or that he had appointed the members constituting the group.
