The plaintiff tendered in evidence a plaint in an earlier suit and relied on an admission made by the defendants with regard to a fact in issue in the later suit.
The High Court ruled that the plaint was not admissible in evidence on two grounds, viz., (i) the plaintiff could not rely on a state ment in the plaint as an admission, as she was not prepared to accept the correctness of the other statements in the plaint and (ii) an admission in a pleading could be used only for the purposes of the suit in which the pleading was filed.
On appeal to this Court.
HELD : (1) All the statements in the plaint are admissible in evidence.
The plaintiff can rely upon a statement in the plaint with regard to a matter in issue as an admission, though she is not prepared to accept the correctness of the other statements in the plaint.
Nor is the Court bound to accept all the statements as correct.
The court may accept some of the statements as correct and reject the rest.
[3 F] (2) Section 17 of the makes no distinction between a admission made by a party in a pleading and other admissions.
An admission made by a party in a plaint signed and verified by him may be used as evidence against him in other suits.
In other suits, this admission cannot be regarded as conclusive and it is open to the party to show that it is not true.
