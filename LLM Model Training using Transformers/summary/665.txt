On April 26, 954, the appellant was arrested for offences under sections 420, 482, 483, 485 and 486 Indian Penal Code and bidis alleged to bear counterfeit trade marks were seized from him.
On this a complaint was filed on May 26, against the appellant that he was in possession of counterfeit bidis, wrappers and labels.
After investigation, the police submitted a charge sheet on September 30, 1954, and summons was ordered to the appellant on July 22, 1955.
The appellant raised a preliminary objection before the Magistrate that the proceedings were barred by section 15 of the Indian Merchandise Marks Act.
He contended that the offence was discovered on April 26, 1954, when he was arrested and the prosecution which commenced with the issue of process against him on July 22, 1954, was beyond the period of one year provided by section 15.
Held, that the prosecution was not barred by section 15 as the prosecution commenced on the presentation of the complaint which was within one year of the discovery of the offence and not on the issuing of the process.
It is settled law that unless there is something to the contrary in the statute, when a private complaint is presented it is the date of presentation thereof that marks the commencement of the prosecution.
The period of limitation is intended to operate against the complainant and not against the Court.
It will defeat the object of the Act and deprive traders of the protection of the law if it were held that the complaint should be thrown out unless process was issued within one year.
of the discovery of the offence.
