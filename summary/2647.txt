In a petition under article 32 of the Constitution the first petitioner 's detention under section 3(1)(a)(i) of the Jammu and Kashmir Preventive Detention Act, 1961 was challenged as illegal on the basis that no grounds of detention were served on him but that an order informing him that it would be against public interest to disclose the grounds to him was served on him after the expiry of 10 days prescribed in section 8; it was contended that his detention was, therefore, illegal.
In the case of the second petitioner it was claimed that the affidavit in reply to the. petition which set out the facts relating to the service of the order of detention and an order under the proviso to section 8 was sworn to by an Additional Secretary on the basis of information derived from the record of the case.
and not by the Jail Superintendent who was alleged to have served the orders on the detenu.
HELD: (1) The detention of the first petitioner was illegal and he must be released.
It is the duty of the detaining authority to communicate the grounds of detention within 10 days of the date of detention if the case does not fall within the proviso to section 8.
If the detaining authority neither communicates the grounds of detention nor informs the detenu under the proviso within 10 days of the detention, the detention would become illegal and a subsequent order under the proviso would not have the effect of rendering the detention legal.

(2) The petition filed by the second petitioner must be dismissed.
The State had annexed to its affidavit a copy of the Government detention order on which the Jail Superintendent had endorsed the fact of its service.
In view of this it was not necessary for the Superintendent to have filed an affidavit of having effected service.
