On State 's appeal against enhancement of compensation for a compact area of 10 acres of land laid out as building sites with fully formed roads and drainage, and acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the High Court reduced the compensation holding that since the roads and drainage occupied a part of the area acquired, proportionate deduction in compensation ought to be made.
The claimant filed appeal by special leave to this Court.
Allowing the appeal, this Court, Held: 1.1.
The High Court was wrong in principle in reducing the compensation on account of roads and drainage.
The fact that these improvements had been made on the land acquired shows that what was acquired was more valuable than what it would have been without the improvements.
[p. 891E F] 1.2.
Accordingly, the judgment of the High Court is set aside and that of the Reference Court is restored.
