The petitioner was convicted by the Sessions Judge under Section 302, IPC.
and the conviction was confirmed by the High Court.
Dismissing the Special Leave Petition, ^ HELD: 1.
The evidence of an eye witness, if accepted is sufficient to warrant conviction though in appropriate cases the Court may as a measure of caution seek some confirming circumstances from other sources.
But ordinarily, the evidence of a truthful eye witness is sufficient without anything more to warrant a conviction and cannot for instance be made to depend for its acceptance on the truthfulness of other items of evidence such as recovery of weapons etc.
at the instance of the accused by the police.
[463 B]] 2.A retracted confession by an accused may form the basis of a conviction of that accused if it receives some general corroboration from other independent sources.
It cannot however, be the basis for convicting a co accused though it may be taken into consideration against co accused also R It is entirely wrong to think that a confession can lead nowhere.
[463D E] 462 In the instant case, the High Court was wrong in treating the evidence of the eye witness as 'one of three legs of a tripod ' which must collapse if any of the other Legs collapses.
It was also wrong in holding that a confession cannot be the foundation of a conviction but can only constitute 'a fourth leg to a tripod ', and that "the confession alone and by itself cannot prove the guilt of an accused." [463C D]
