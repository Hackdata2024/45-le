The appellants were holders of pre settlement minor inams.
The grants were not of whole villages but of certain lands and they comprised both the melwaram and kudiwaram rights in the lands.
The definition of 'estate ' in the Orissa Estates Abolition Act, 1951, did not include a minor inam.
But by the Orissa Estates Abolition (Amendment) Act, 1954, the definition was enlarged to cover minor inams also.
Both the Acts had received the assent of the President.
The appe llants contended (i) that the Amendment Act of 1954 was not a law for the compulsory acquisition of property for a public purpose and was not saved by article 31 A of the Constitution and (ii) that the minor inams were outside the scope of the Abolition Act and could not be resumed.
Held, that the Amendment Act of 1954 was valid and was within the Protection of article 31A.
In assenting to this Act, the President assented to new categories of properties being brought within the operation of the abolition Act of 1951, and he, in fact, assented to the law for the compulsory acquisition for public purpose of these new categories of property.
Though the minor inams were not of whole villages and included both the warams, they were nevertheless inams" and the Constitution defined an "estate" as including "any" inam and fell within the scope of Abolition Act of 1951 as amended in 1954.
The ejusdem generis rule cannot be applied to Inam in the definition of "estate" in article 31A(2)(a) because particular categories like "jagir, in am or muafi", are included in the definition expressly even though the rule may apply to "other similar grants" which expression may take its colour from the categories named.
The ejusdem generis rule is applicable where a wide or general term has to be cut down with reference to the genus of the particular terms which precede the general words, 251
