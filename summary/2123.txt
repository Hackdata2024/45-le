At a trial, the appellants gave evidence against the respondent.
After the Conclusion of the trial the respondent filed a petition in the court of the Magistrate under section 476(1) Criminal Procedure Code, praying for the prosecution of the appellants for giving false evidence under section 193 Indian Penal Code, and adduced evidence in sup port of his contention.
The Magistrate thought that in the interest of justice the, appellants should be prosecuted and accordingly filed a complaint.
The appellants contended that the complaint was not maintainable because the trying Magistrate had not followed the procedure under section 479 A, Criminal Procedure Code and it was therefore not open to the Magistrate to take recourse to the provisions of section 476.
HELD: The prosecution of the appellants under the provisions of section 476 Criminal Procedure Code by the Magistrate after the conclusion of the trial was legally valid and wag not affected by the bar of cl.
(6) of section 479 A. Criminal Procedure Code.
[377G] The bar of cl.
(6) will not apply to a case where perjury is detected not merely with reference to the evidence adduced at the trial but with reference to the evidence adduced in some other distinct proceeding not then brought before the court or because there is some other material subsequently produced after the conclusion of the trial and delivery of judgment which renders the prosecution for perjury essential in the interests of justice.
