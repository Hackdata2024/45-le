Section 95 of the prescribes the requirements of an insurance policy and the "limits of liability" thereunder.
Section 95(2) (a) was amended by the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act 56 of 1969 to provide that the insurer 's liability under a policy of insurance be increased from the existing "twenty thousand rupees" to "fifty thousand rupees".
The amendment came into force on March 2,1970.
The appellant 's husband, who was driving a scooter was knocked down dead by a truck on April 5, 1970.
The owner of the truck had taken a statutory insurance policy with the respondent which was operative from June 30,1969 to June 29, 1970.
The appellant filed an application before the Motor Accident 's Claims Tribunal under section 110 A of the Act seeking compensation for her husband 's death.
The respondent denied its liability and contested the application The Tribunal passed an award holding that the appellant was entitled to recover compensation in the sum of Rs. 60,000 for self and her children, but limited the liability of the respondent insurer to a sum of Rs. 50,000.
The respondent in its appeal to the High Court contended that on the date on which the insurance policy was issued, its statutory liability was limited to a sum Rs. 20,000 only, and therefore the Tribunal was in error in passing an award against it for a sum of Rs. 50,000.
This contention was accepted, and the appeal was allowed.
245 In the claimant 's appeal to this Court on the question whether the insurer 's liability for third party risks under the statutory policy must be held to be limited to Rs. 20,000 according to the relevant legal provision as it existed on the date on which the policy came into force, or whether that liability can be extended to Rs. 50,000 in accordance with the legal provision as it stood on the date of the accident, the accident having occurred during the currency of the policy.
Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: 1.
The material date for ascertaining the extent of liability of the insurer is the date of the accrual of the cause of action for a claim arising out of an accident, which in general would be the date of the accident and therefore, the insurer 's liability arising out of an accident which happens after March 2, 1970 has to be determined on the basis of the amended provisions of section 95(2) (a) of the Act, even though the policy of insurance may have been issued prior to the date of the amendment, that is, prior to March 2, 1970.
[249 G H; 250A B] 2.
The governing factor for determining the application of the appropriate law is not the date on which the policy of insurance came into force, but the date on which the cause of action accrued for enforcing liability arising under the terms of the policy.
[248 G] 3.
The application of a law to facts which came into existence after that law has come into force does not involve giving retrospective operation to the law, merely because the facts to which the law is being applied are relatable to a contract or an instrument which had come into operation prior to the date on which the law itself had come into force.

If the parties to a contract agree that one shall pay to the other damages for breach of contract in accordance with the law contained in any particular statute without identifying the law as the provision which is in force on the date of the contract, the law which will apply for determining the quantum of damages is the one which is in force on which the breach of contract is committed, that being the date on which the cause of action arises, and not the law which was in force on the date on which the contract was made.
[249 B C] In the instant case, the insurance policy came into force on June 30, 1969 and covered the period from June 30, 1969 to June 29, 1970.
The amendment by which the statutory liability of the insurer was increased from Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 50,000 came into force on March 2, 1970.
The accident which gave rise to these proceedings occurred on April 5, 1970.
The extent of the insurer 's liability must therefore be determined by the application of the law introduced by the Amendment which had come into force before the date of accident.
